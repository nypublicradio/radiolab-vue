We start with Sir Isaac Newton, who was so eager to solve this very mystery, he stuck a knife in his eye to pinpoint the answer. Then, we meet a sea creature that sees a rainbow way beyond anything humans can experience, and we track down a woman who we're pretty sure can see thousands (maybe even millions) more colors than the rest of us. And we end with an age-old question, that, it turns out, never even occurred to most humans until very recently: why is the sky blue?</p>",

And we mentioned they don&rsquo;t seem to gaze at sunsets or rainbows. We now think that maybe they use colors as kind of triggers for particular actions. One color says fight, another color they - eat! Other color says sex.

And I wanted to take a quick second to tell you about something that uh - that I think&rsquo;s pretty interesting that that we make here. Uh - besides the show. So we have a newsletter which I know everyone does but hear me out. Unlike a lot of other newsletters out there uh - we don&rsquo;t waste your time by just blabbing about what our next release will be or begging you for money.</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>#00:19:30.65#</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Uh actually we we do uh a little bit of that. But what what we also do is - each time a new episode drops we send you a list of staff picks. Essentially a collection of things the folks here who make the show have come across recently and are excited about uh - they range from books and music to TV shows, YouTube clips, art exhibits, blogs. It&rsquo;s sort of a repository for the stuff that&rsquo;s got us interested but for whatever reason we&rsquo;re not sure how to turn into a</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>#00:20:00.37#</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>radio story. So if that sounds interesting to you at all I hope you&rsquo;ll sign up for it. Our newsletter it&rsquo;s free and you can sign up in about just 30 seconds at radiolab.org slash newsletter or - even easier just text RLNews as in Radiolab News - to 70101. That&rsquo;s RLNews to 70101.

If you can take a color blind human and give them normal color vision could you take a color see-er and boost em to make em a little more shrimpy?</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>#00:24:30.04#</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>JN: Well - yes,</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>MUSIC IN</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>yeah.</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>JA: He said sure, why not?

To practice? It may just lay dormant.

Okay, I want to announce something that's kind of new. You know, we've been making Radiolab for a long time, almost 20 years. And one of the questions that we get almost more than any other is which of your episodes are kid-friendly? Which episodes can I listen to with my kids? And it felt like a really important question to answer now that so many of us are isolated in our homes and having to figure out home schooling. I'm certainly in that situation. So we wanted to -- we wanted to help you guys out. So we launched a new podcast, it's called Radiolab For Kids. Basically, we went through our entire archives, gathered together some of our most favorite kid-friendly episodes and put them all in one place. You can go to Radiolab.org and subscribe to it there or, you know, wherever you get your podcasts, search for Radiolab For Kids and you'll find it. And we're gonna keep adding to this feed. And just to kick the whole thing off, I thought I would play one episode that's in that group that we've curated. This is one of the first Radiolabs I ever made, and the reason I wanted to start with this one is, you know, it's funny, I've been having a lot of conversations in the last few weeks with my oldest kid who's 10. He's been asking me a lot of questions about space and black holes, and I found it to be a really comforting topic of conversation right now. And I don't know why, maybe it's something about the scale. You know, we're in this moment where we're thinking about shifting of scales, giant pandemics sweeping the globe, how humans are so tiny and powerless at times. And all of this can be very scary. Here's a chance to take some of that same way of thinking, that same way of shifting scales, but apply it to something that's much more about wonder and discovery. So hope you enjoy it. Here's an episode all the way back from the beginning of Radiolab. It's called Space.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>[RADIOLAB INTRO]</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Some people go to therapy, some to church.

But say what you will, we are trying.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Speaking of which, let's begin by rewinding the clock back to 1977.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>This was a big year for the space program, because in August of that year NASA launched a spacecraft carrying a gold record. You remember this, right?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>I do. I remember.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>The record carried a message from us to them. Our story. Now it was Carl Sagan ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Carl Sagan: </em></strong><em><span>The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Who led the team that made the record, and that team included -- actually, it was headed by Annie Druyan. I visited Annie at her home in Ithaca, New York, and we sat in the backyard near a waterfall in the same spot she says where Carl himself would sit and become so absorbed in what he was reading that he would not notice a deer standing right next to him.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE DRUYAN: </em></strong><em><span>My name is Annie Druyan, and I was honored to be the Creative Director of the Voyager Interstellar Message Project, which began in early 1977.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>Now how did this come about? I think about the project now, and it's so exciting to think about. I mean, it's such a romantic idea. Did you know that at the time?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE DRUYAN: </em></strong><em><span>Absolutely. We felt, first of all, that this was a kind of sacred trust. That here we were, half a dozen very flawed human beings with huge -- huge holes in our knowledge of all of these subjects, building a cultural Noah's Ark. It was a chance to tell something of what life on Earth was like to beings of perhaps a thousand million years from now, because the -- the Voyager engineers were saying this record will have a shelf life of a billion years. If that didn't raise goosebumps then you'd have to be made of wood. It was also the -- the season that Carl Sagan and I fell so madly in love with each other. And here we were taking on this mythic challenge and knowing that before it was done two spacecraft would lift off from the planet Earth moving at an average speed of 35,000 miles an hour for the next thousand million years, and on it would be a kiss, a mother's first words to her newborn baby, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, greetings in the 59 most populous human languages, as well as one non-human language, the greetings of the humpback whales. And it was a sacred undertaking, because it was saying we want to be citizens of the cosmos. We want you to know about us.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>Tell me about the moment you fell in love with Carl Sagan. You said it was during the Voyager compilation.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE DRUYAN: </em></strong><em><span>Yes, it was. It was on June 1st, 1977. I had been looking for some time for that piece of Chinese music that we could put on the Voyager record and not feel like idiots for having done so. And I was very excited because I'd finally found a ethnomusicologist composer at Columbia University who told me without a moment's hesitation that this piece, Flowing Streams, which was represented to me as one of the oldest pieces of Chinese music, 2,500 years old, was the piece we should put on the record. So I called Carl who was traveling. He was in Tucson, Arizona, giving a talk. And we had been alone many times during the making of the record and as friends for three years, and neither of us had ever said anything to the other. We were both involved with other people. We'd had these wonderful, soaring conversations, but we had both been completely just professional about everything and as friends. And he wasn't there, left a message. Hour later, phone rings. Pick up the phone and I hear this wonderful voice, and he said, \"I get back to my hotel room and I find this message and it says Annie called. And I say to myself, 'Why didn't you leave me this message 10 years ago?'\" And my heart completely skipped a beat. I can still remember it so perfectly. And I said, \"For keeps?\" And he said, \"You mean, get married?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" And we had never kissed, we had never, you know, even had any kind of personal discussion before. We both hung up the phone and I just screamed out loud. I remember it so well, because it was this great eureka moment. It was just like a scientific discovery. And then the phone rang, you know? Like -- and it was Carl, and he said, \"I just want to make sure. That really happened. We're getting married, right?\" And I said, \"Yeah, we're getting married.\" He said, \"Okay. Just wanted to make sure.\" And the spacecraft lifted off on August 20th, and August 22nd we told everyone involved. And we were together from that moment until his death in 1996 in December.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>Wow, talk about romantic, my God!</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE DRUYAN: </em></strong><em><span>It was so romantic. And part of my feeling about Voyager obviously, and part of what I was feeling in the recording of my brain waves, my heart, my eyes, everything in that meditation on the record. I had asked Carl whether or not it would be possible to compress the impulses in one's brain and nervous system into sound and then put that sound on the record and then think that perhaps the extraterrestrials of the future would be able to reconstitute that data into thought. And he looked at me on a beautiful May day in New York City and said, \"Well, you know, a thousand million years is a long time, you know? Why don't you go do it, because who knows, you know? Who knows what's possible in a thousand million years?\" And so my brain waves and REM, every little sound that my body was making was recorded at Bellevue Hospital in New York. This was two days after Carl and I declared our love for each other. And so what I often think is that maybe a hundred million years from now, you know, somebody flags that record down, and I always wonder because part of what I was thinking in this meditation was about the wonder of love and of being in love. And to know it's on those two spacecraft. Even now in my -- whenever I'm down, you know, I'm thinking, \"And still they move. 35,000 miles an hour, leaving our solar system for the great wide open sea of interstellar space.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Billions of years from now, the sun will have reduced this planet to a charred ashy ball, but that record with Ann Druyan's brain waves and heartbeat on it will still be out there somewhere intact in some remote region of the Milky Way preserving a murmur of an ancient civilization that once flourished on a distant planet.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Two hearts on a wing. Very nice.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>It's lovely, right?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Yeah, it is. Although there are six plus billion earthlings right now, and the best thing I think about Earth is that we're so various.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Right.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>So you're gonna get six-plus billion versions of being an Earthling.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, like if you were Annie Druyan and Carl Sagan, what would your recipe of us be? So we asked a bunch of people.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Who?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Comedian Margaret Cho, you know her?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Uh-huh.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Neil Gaiman, this graphic novelist. Michael Cunningham, an author. The very famous chef Alice Waters. They all sort of, you know, told us what they would send. I'll play you one. Not gonna play all ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Yeah, just one. I don't want to hear them all.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>It would take too long. You can hear all of them on our website actually, Radiolab.org. But here is one guy we asked. He's a composer.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PHILIP GLASS: </em></strong><em><span>This is Philip Glass speaking. The reason I've chosen Bach is that he had the ability to do two things at once. One was to -- to deal concretely with the language of music, almost you could say grammar of music. At the same time, while he was doing a lot, say, with one part of his brain, he was able to create music that we empathize with. He takes you by the hand as it were, and walks you into states of being that you didn't even know existed. Bach goes out in the spaceship. Whether anybody can hear it or not, we'll put it in the spaceship. But I would also recommend strongly that we bring music in from other world traditions, whether it's from Africa, or whether it's kind of a throat singing that you might hear in Siberia or in the Arctic, or wonderful flute playing that you might hear in South India. I was in India in 1966 or '67, and I was in a small village in the Himalayas called Kalimpong on the border of Bhutan and Tibet. And a friend of mine, a rug dealer, I had been in his shop numerous times to look at his rugs, ran out of the shop and said, \"Oh, Mr. Glass come with me. I want to show you a picture.\" And he had gotten ahold of a film clip of Gandhi. It was a march he took in the '30s called the -- it was known as the Salt March. The English had put a tax on the use of salt. Thousands and thousands of people joined him and they walked into the sea, and they took their garments, put them into the water and harvested the salt.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Mahatma Gandhi: </em></strong><em><span>There is an indefinable mysterious power that pervades everything. I feel it, though I do not see it.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PHILIP GLASS: </em></strong><em><span>And I saw the picture of this tiny little man really, surrounded by thousands upon thousands of people leading this march. And it was so moving. I think what you have to do is get that piece of footage. It articulates in this very simple act how societies change, how people that appear to be powerless and insignificant can bring about huge changes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Jad here.

What do you have to ask that question? I mean, it's just a gesture. It's like a romantic thing.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>No, no. This is an attempt, I think, to be fair to her, to have a real conversation. She wants someone to hear about this, but the chances are so remote when you consider the vastness of space. Suppose for example, you wanted to visit just -- I don't know, make it easy, the very next star to us, okay? Actually, that's too lucky. To meet a civilization, I think it would be so odd to come out and find one in the very first stop. Let's go four stars out to a star called Zeta Tucanae.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I see. You've been digging up on this.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>I look -- I admit I looked it up.

And when I want to ask questions about space ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Yes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>I usually go to this guy.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>See, now I realize what's happening here. I hear you through that speaker, but not through my headphones.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Who is this?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>This is Brian Greene, Professor of Mathematics and of Physics at Columbia University.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Are we -- are we on? Okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>So Jad, I said to Brian if we've got a spacecraft crawling through this vast, vast empty universe, how long a trip is it for just to start from wherever it is now to the -- to the end of the universe? And by the way, what is -- where is the end of the universe?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>That's a very natural question. You know, in most environments you can walk for a while, but then you hit the end, you hit the end of the city, the end of the state, the end of the country. But when it comes to the universe, we believe that there's probably no edge. There is no end. Now how do you picture that? Well, one possibility is that maybe that the universe just goes on forever.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Mm-hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>Space may just carry on, you can just keep on going and you'll just never run out of space. The other possibility is it could be that you walk off into space for a while and you keep on walking, and after a while you realize that you've actually circled back to your starting point. Sort of like on the surface of the Earth, you don't find an edge. You can't fall off the Earth's surface because when you walk ultimately you'll come back to your starting point. That idea may apply to the fabric of space, to the entire cosmos.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Although the Earth analogy is a little insufficient because when I'm walking in Central Park, I am on the edge of the Earth, because when I look down I see Earth, but when I look up I see non-Earth, I see gas around the earth. So I'm at the edge.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>Well ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>It's as if I were on a balloon. I'm on the surface of the balloon looking out at non-balloonness.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, that's where the analogy fails. If you're on the surface of the Earth, you can jump off, you can jump up.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>So it feels like you're on an edge. But in the universe there is no notion of jumping off because there is nothing beyond the space that we inhabit. It is all there is, and there is nothing outside of it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>And now to make things even harder for our little capsule traveling through space, we now know that space, that the universe and the space that it is is expanding, constantly expanding. So imagine our little craft, all alone in nothingness, and every minute there's more nothingness and more nothingness and more nothingness and more ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Has this always been happening?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>We think it's been happening since the very beginning. So if the Big Bang was the origin of the universe then this expansion has been going on for 13.7 billion years.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>So there's more space all the time?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>Yes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Does that mean that it takes a longer time to go from one part of the universe to another, is that ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>Absolutely. Absolutely.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>So when you say something like the universe is expanding, what that seems to mean to you is that the empty spaces in the universe are getting bigger?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>Yes. So the -- the intuitive but wrong picture would be that you picture the universe expanding into a pre-existing space, a pre-existing realm that the universe is now filling.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Like a balloon.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>Like a balloon. Filling, say, the room in which you're blowing it up.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>But that imagery is wrong in the following way: It's not that the universe is expanding into a pre-existing space, it's that as the universe expands it creates more space. It creates the new space that it then in habits.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Does that mean that there's no middle of the universe?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>Yes. The old idea was that there is a central point in the universe, and the old idea was that we were at that central point in the universe. But in the current way and more modern way of thinking about the universe, there is no center. The universe is actually expanding, but it's not expanding from a certain point in space. All of space is stretching uniformly.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Brian Greene is Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Columbia University. This leaves us in a sort of strange position.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, lonely position.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>In the sense that we have this little capsule riding somewhere in a space which just keeps changing. We don't know where it is or where we are relative to other things, and whatever we know is changing all the time. It used to be so different. Neil deGrasse Tyson who runs the Hayden Planetarium in New York City says once upon a time we knew where we were, at least we thought we knew where we were, and we were the stars.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Well, before Copernicus, the idea of our place in the universe was largely accepted to be the center. It looked that way, for sure. You stand here on Earth and look up and the sun rises and sets and the moon rises and sets and the stars rise and set and the planets rise and set. When Copernicus came around, he put the sun in the middle of the known universe, allowing the planets to then go around the sun, relegating Earth to the status of a planet being one of these objects that goes around the Sun.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Now that was a very dangerous idea at the time, apparently.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Yes, because that idea conflicted with all prevailing interpretation of scripture. It had deep societal ramifications, and Copernicus knew this. He knew it so well that he said, \"I'm gonna make sure I'm dead before this hits the bestseller list.\" So ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>You mean, he didn't want to publish during his own lifetime?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>This book was basically published on his deathbed.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Copernicus was 1600s?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, 15.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>15?

So -- so now we're no longer -- humankind is no longer at the center of things. Now what?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Well, we're no longer at the center of the then-known universe.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Right.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>The then-known universe was the objects of the solar system, the planets. But you look up at the night sky beyond the planets, what do you see? Stars. There's stars in every direction. In fact, if you count how many stars are to your left, how many are to your right, how many are above and below -- it's about the same in every direction you look. Hey, maybe even if Earth is not the center of the solar system, the solar system is in the center of the rest of the universe.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah. That's the ticket, okay? Now we can dig out of this hole that Copernicus put us in.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Let's go ahead and do that.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>So our group is king.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Oh yeah. Our little family of planets, we're in the center. And so that prevailed for a while, because it's a comforting concept not only for the public but for the scientists as well. It wasn't until the 1920s where Harlow Shapley, then head of Harvard College Observatory, noticed globular clusters. Those were more in one direction of the sky than the other.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Huh.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>And he deduced that these things ought to know where the center of the gravity is, rather than these measly handful of stars that are sitting in front of us around on the sky.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, you mean these big, fat concentration of stars?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Big, fat, hundred thousand star beehive concentrations of stars. Star clusters. They ought to know where the center of the galaxy is, even if these single stars don't. And so he deduced that the center of the galaxy was off in the direction of Sagittarius on the sky, okay? So now people are fighting that, people are fighting that, but then all hell breaks loose because 1920s come in, Edwin Hubble grabs the business end of the biggest telescope of the day, and determines that these fuzzy things among the stars are not the same distance as the stars themselves. They're vastly farther away. In fact, you know, they kind of look like what this collection of stars might look like from afar. In fact, maybe they are other Milky Ways, maybe they are other galaxies, maybe we're not the whole story.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Oh boy.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Man.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Meanwhile, the sky keeps getting bigger and bigger and deeper and deeper and bigger and deeper and bigger and deeper. Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Man, oh this was terrible for the ego.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>I can tell you I'm disappointed myself.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, man. And so now okay, maybe we're in the center of the -- that universe.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, let's hope for that.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Because we look this way, we see about the same number of galaxies this way as that way as that way as that way. Kind of looks like we're at the center. And they're all receding from us. So hey, we're at the center then. You know, but now we're smarter than this now. We're saying we're not gonna fall for that, okay? We've fallen for that one nine times already. We're not gonna fall for this again.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>You mean, somebody's sitting there in the corner thinking, \"Every time we make ourselves the star of the show, we're wrong.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>We're wrong. So I'm -- we're not gonna make that mistake again. And so you then apply Einstein's general theory of relativity, and it says if you live in an expanding universe, in this fabric of space and time, no matter where you are it will look like you're at the center.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Which means what? There is no center?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Yes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Every center is an illusion.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Yes. And so that's how we could look like we're at the center of the actual universe, even though we're not, because everybody sees the same signature of the expansion. Now there's an even stronger argument for -- than the numerics. Let's look at the ingredients of the human body. You learn from biology class we're mostly water.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Right.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>But what is water mostly?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Hydrogen and oxygen.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Hydrogen. Hydrogen and oxygen. Let's look in the cosmos. The number one ingredient in the cosmos is hydrogen. Next in the universe: Oxygen. Next on Earth and in life: Oxygen. Next in the universe: Carbon. Next in life: Carbon. Next in the universe: Nitrogen. Next in life: Nitrogen. One for one you go down the list. We are not simply in this universe, the universe is in us.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>So we're not the center of the universe, we are on the side. Then our gang is not the center of everything but it's just out on a wing, and then a galaxy that we're a part of is one of many. And the fact that we are alive is maybe not unique.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>I got something worse ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>How low can we go?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, we can go lower.

It turns out the shuttle that picked up the probe in 1990 and brought it back was the Columbia.

And I remember feeling in first walking on the moon, when Americans first walked on the moon, you know, I was enraged at my government's conduct in the world, horrified by it. But I had to admit that it made me really proud. And then as soon as NASA became involved with the space shuttle, we lost the grand purpose. And it was very much to me as a mother of two children, remembering when they were young that when they would -- were toddlers and they were first learning to walk, they would run away from me and encounter some frightening reality 10, 12 feet away and then turn around and come running back to be around my ankles.

Guys, I'm gonna take my hat on as an American. I am thankful that 500 years ago, thousands of people gave their lives to cross the Atlantic and explore the Americas. And I'm thankful that -- that 200 years ago they crossed the Great Plains. No one has the right to say for my children and their children that we shouldn't take the risk now to open these frontiers. And if it's up to the individual to risk their life, so be it.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><span>[Audience applauds]</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, but that's -- that's -- that was a cop-out answer, I have to say. Because when those people he's referring to, the people who crossed the Atlantic, crossed the plains, when they did all those things and then when many of them died, I mean thousands of -- I don't know how many.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Thousands, I'm sure.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Anyway, but when they died, those early Americans, they died alone. There were no TV cameras around, there was no Scott Simon on the radio. They were by themselves.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>I think you're right.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>It was a completely different time.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>When you make it sensational, people will die sensationally. And then what's gonna happen to the money and the entrepreneurs and the businessmen?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Right. That's exactly right.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Businessmen don't exactly have a sterling reputation for sticking by their guns. If you have a small financial problem showing up in Brazil, people all over the world pull their money out of Brazil. You get a total rush for the exits. Total collapse.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>It's true, they're always the first to leave. You know, money and wealth, it's good motivators to get us back to space, but once you get there, it's got to be about something more than that.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Like what, though? Because I agree with you, it's just ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Well, it's -- I don't even know what to call it, exactly. But you certainly hear it. Take the last transmissions from the moon in December of 1972.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Uh-huh. Oh, last time we were there.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, the last time we were there.

I was seventeen years old. And the concussion is bad enough that it slowed my brain enough that I couldn't read. And so naturally I couldn't go to school.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Which sucked for her.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: At seventeen I was very much a nerd and I was bored out of my mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: So imagine Susan sitting there in the hospital. &nbsp;One day one of her friends&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: A friend of mine who was just a little older and had graduated the semester before me suggested going to the nearby university and crashing classes&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Now wait a second why would you go&mdash;if your brain was working slowly why wouldn&rsquo;t you go swimming?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Well I couldn&rsquo;t read but I could listen and I could hear and the person was saying &ldquo;oh it&rsquo;s a lot better than high school.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So one day she was at this college.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Just kind of wandering down a random hallway.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: And I opened the first door on the left. That was the accident that changed my whole life; just picking that door.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: At the front of the room there was this older guy. He was thin he was bald and he was tracing shapes in the air with his hands.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: It was as if there were pictures being painted in the air and then they immediately disappeared.&nbsp; Then another picture appeared. I was mesmerized.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Wow.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: The professor was signing.</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: This class was actually one of the first classes to teach sign at a regular hearing university, ever.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: I had also walked into history but didn't know it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Fast forward five years Susan now is fluent in sign. &nbsp;She moves to Los Angeles. &nbsp;It's the late 1970s.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: And I was snatched and put into interpreter training programs because at that time they were very, very few interpreters. &nbsp;And I found myself in a classroom.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: In a community college.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: In something called a reading skills class.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: So she walks into the class.&nbsp; She sees kids all over the classroom making big excited gestures one to the other.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: And at the door I saw this man holding himself.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Kind of off by himself.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Making his own straitjacket.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: She went over to the instructor and she pointed at the guy and she said, &ldquo;Who, who's that guy over there.&rdquo; And the instructor said, &ldquo;Well, he was born deaf. &nbsp;His uncle, he has this kind of insistent uncle who, who brings him here every day. &nbsp;We, we don't know exactly what to do with him though.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: What did this guy look like?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: He was a beautiful, um, well now I know, I don't know if I would have had that in my head at the time, beautiful looking Mayan.&nbsp; You know, high cheekbones and black hair, black eyes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: And something about his eyes caught her attention.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: He was studying mouths and I walked up to him and said, &ldquo;Hello my name is Susan.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And this is where things start to get a little weird. He looks at her. And instead of signing his name whatever it was.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: He brings up his hands&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Signs right back to her,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: &ldquo;Hello my name is Susan.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Susan like shakes her head and says, &ldquo;No, no, I'm Susan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And he responds, &ldquo;No, no I'm Susan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Everything you said, he tried to say.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Exactly. I call it a visual echolalia.&nbsp; And I remember thinking&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Why is he doing this?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: I mean Susan did he, did he look like he had some kind of disability or condition.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: He was uh, he was intelligent.&nbsp; I wouldn't have been able to answer if you asked me &ldquo;how can you see intelligence?&rdquo; &nbsp;But you can actually see intelligence in people's eyes</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: He was just missing something.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: To copy me meant that he didn't really know what I was doing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: And that's when it occurred to her</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: This man doesn&rsquo;t have language.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Wait how old was this guy?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: He was 27 years old.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And in all that time no one had taught him sign language or anything?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Well he didn&rsquo;t know he was deaf.&nbsp; He was born deaf. &nbsp;He didn't know there was sound.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Really?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: 27 years no idea that there was sound.&nbsp; He could see the mouth moving.&nbsp; He could see people responding.&nbsp; He thought we figured all this stuff out visually.&nbsp; And he thought, &ldquo;I must be stupid.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And so here's the question for our hour. This is Radiolab.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m Jad Abumrad.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: I&rsquo;m Robert Krulwich.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Words.&nbsp; What do words do for us?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Are they necessary?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Can you live without &lsquo;em?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Can you think without them?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Can you dream without them? Can you&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: That&rsquo;s enough.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Can you swim without them?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: No, no, that&rsquo;s enough.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Alright, back to the story.&nbsp; So this man that Susan met, we don't actually know his real name but when she wrote about him in her book, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">A Man without Words</span>, she called him Ildefonso.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: There they are sitting in the classroom. &nbsp;She's right there with him.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Of course she's wondering&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: What have you've been doing for 27 years?! (<em>Laughing.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: So she thinks well let me see if I can teach him some just basic sign language.&nbsp; In an interesting case she takes out a book and makes the sign book.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: But the sign for book looks like opening up a book.&nbsp; So he thought I was ordering him to open a book.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: So he grabs the book and he opens it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Cuz he thought I was asking him to do something. &nbsp;It was very difficult.&nbsp; If I gave him the sign for standing up he thought I wanted him to stand up. &nbsp;And so I couldn't, I couldn't have a conversation with him. And it was the most frustrating thing I have ever done in my life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Wait a second, how long did this go on for?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Well uh weeks, it was weeks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Wow.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Often times when we said goodbye or just left, (we couldn&rsquo;t really say goodbye), I really believed that we wouldn't see each other again and I was often times very surprised when he would be sitting there at the table.&nbsp; And I think sometimes he looked surprised that I showed up.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: But after a couple of weeks of him&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Constantly miming, copying me.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: She had an idea.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Perhaps it's just possible that if I, if I died tomorrow I would have had only one really, really good thought in my life.&nbsp; And this was it: I'm going to ignore him.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: I taught an invisible student. &nbsp;I stopped talking to him and I stopped having eye contact. And I set up an empty chair</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And then she says she would hold up to this empty chair a picture of a cat.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: and I was trying to explain to this invisible student that this creature, a cat&mdash;so I'd be miming a cat and petting a cat&mdash;and then I&rsquo;d sign the sign for cat.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Then she would hop to the other seat, the invisible student&rsquo;s seat, and pretend to get it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: \"Oh I know,&rdquo; you know with my facial expression, &ldquo;Oh, I get it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: So you're playing all the parts. &nbsp;You're both the teacher and the invisible student.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Wow.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Doing all these crazy things and he&rsquo;d just watch me.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: He stopped copying her which was good&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: But. I&rsquo;d do this over and over and over for days and days and days&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: And she says he just didn't get it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: He looked bored a lot of times.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: But one day in the middle of one of these endless pretend student exercises&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Something happened.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Out of the corner of her eye, she sees him shift his body.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: And he looked&mdash;It's interesting how his body was upright and he looked like something was about to happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He looked around the room&mdash;this is a 27 year old man&mdash; and he looks around the room as if he had just landed from Mars and it was the first time he had ever saw anything. Something was about to happen.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: His eyes grew wider, she says, and then wider.&nbsp; And then&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: He slaps his hands on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! Everything has a name!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: And he looks at me in this demanding way and I sign table.&nbsp; And he points to the door and I sign door. And he points to the clock and he points to me, and I sign &ldquo;Susan.&rdquo; And then, he started crying.&nbsp; He just collapsed and he started crying.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: What is it that happens in human beings when we get symbols and we start trading symbols? It changes our thinking.&nbsp; It changes our ideas of&mdash;it is no longer the thing, a table that we eat on but there's something about symbol table that makes the table look different. Ildefonso was in love. He was in love.&nbsp; He was like, everything has a name. And for the first couple weeks he had this list of names that kept growing and growing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Paper.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Eagle.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Clock.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Green.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: I kept copying words for him.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Cat.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Alligator.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Cat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Cardinal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Gave him the sign for door.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Door.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Door.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Then I would-</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Door.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Write d-o-o-r.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Serpent.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Cheetah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: And he&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Strawberries.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Folded this paper.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Paper.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: As if it was&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Treasure!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Treasure and he would pull it out everyday and he would&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Lion</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Carefully unfold it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Tiger.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: And he would add to it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Orange juice.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>10 minutes</em>.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Apple.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Blue Jay.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Thinking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Believe.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Horse.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Leaf.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Idea.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Add to it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Lamb.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Lou. ***</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Table.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Bird.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Wall.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Dove.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Name.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Add to it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Pig.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Left.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: From.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Right.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Cows.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Hawk</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Left of the blue wall.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Octopus.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Symbol.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Treasure.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Words.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Eggs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Ham.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Hippopotamus.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: What is it that happens in human beings when we get symbols?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Symbols.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: And that, you know, once you have begun to put words onto things you can look at a thing, say this symbolic sound, table, and the person opposite you knows what you are talking about.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But she seems to be saying something deeper though, when you get the word for table than suddenly the table, like this table right here (knocking <em>on the table</em>), looks different.&nbsp; Like it&rsquo;s somehow the word changes the world, in some fundamental way.&nbsp; Now I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true about the table thing, but consider what happens when you put words together, okay, when you link them up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Good, okay.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So I want to tell you about this experiment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Fantastic.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: That I learned about from a fellow I talk to sometimes.&nbsp; Charles&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: I&rsquo;m Charles Fernyhough.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a psychologist at Durham University in the UK.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Fernyhough.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And uh, when I first read about this experiment in Charles&rsquo;

The whole thing happens in a room.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Yeah you&rsquo;re put into this room which is colored completely white.&nbsp; The walls are white.&nbsp; The ceilings white.&nbsp;

So on your left hand side&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Are we in a rectangle, is what you&rsquo;re describing?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Yeah, it&rsquo;s a rectangular room.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Are you with me so far?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: I&rsquo;m with you so far.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Okay so just to give you some of the baseline conditions here: Imagine you are a rat in this room.&nbsp; Okay?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: And somebody comes along and hides an object in one corner of the room.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: What?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: It can be anything.&nbsp; I mean for rats you would food.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Like a biscuit or something?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: You hide a biscuit in one of the four corners.&nbsp; You see it but before you can get to it they pick you up by your tail, spin you around a bunch of times&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: So you don&rsquo;t know where you are; you don&rsquo;t know which direction you are facing in.&nbsp; And then they right, now go find the biscuit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So if you do this with a rat, what will happen, is it will say alright let me go find the biscuit and it will&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.&nbsp; The pitter patter of a mouse scampering across the floor.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Go to one corner which looks right.&nbsp; But of course the room also looks like that if you turn around through 180 degrees and face exactly the opposite direction.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Because it&rsquo;s a rectangle.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: So they get it right 50% of the time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Because corners of rectangles, two of them are identical.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Alright so uh (<em>coughing</em>) should we get on with this, because I&rsquo;m well aware of rectangles.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: I just needed to get that out of the way because the cool part is coming up now.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: I hope so.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: What the experimenters did next is they took one of the four white walls and they turned it blue.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So imagine this scenario: your in this room, you&rsquo;ve got these four white walls, or rather three white walls.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: One of them is blue.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Right. &nbsp;Well now you&rsquo;re not confused anymore.&nbsp; You can relate everything to the blue wall.&nbsp; You can be like the corner with the biscuit was left of the blue wall or right of the blue wall.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: I like it to the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: You now have a blue wall as a&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Navigational clue.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Yes!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: That makes sense you know, we would all be able to do that, that&rsquo;s not going to be difficult for us.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Alright have we got to the good part yet?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Turns out though&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: The rats, he says,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: They&rsquo;re still scoring fifty/fifty.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: What?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: It&rsquo;s as if they can&rsquo;t take any notice of the blue wall.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Even with the blue wall they can only find the biscuit 50% of the time!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Wait a second, can rats see color?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Yeah, rats can do color.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: They do color pretty well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Okay.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: They also do left, right just fine.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: But what they can&rsquo;t do is connect those two bits of information together.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: In other words they can only, well they can do left; that they can do. &nbsp;They can do blue but they&rsquo;re both separate.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t do left of blue.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: These different kinds of knowledge can&rsquo;t talk to each other.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: How does anyone know that? I mean, what rats have been interviewed for this?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: What? They infer this based on studying the rats.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: So the rat doesn&rsquo;t have what? Doesn&rsquo;t have the neurons doesn&rsquo;t have the&mdash;what doesn&rsquo;t he have?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: The rat can&rsquo;t do it, that&rsquo;s all they need to know.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m going to make it weirder now&hellip;neither can some humans.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: I spent the first ten or fifteen years of my scientific life studying creatures who don&rsquo;t talk yet.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: That&rsquo;s Elizabeth Spelke; she&rsquo;s a psychologist at Harvard.&nbsp; Quite famous for her work with um&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Sounds from the lab.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Kai</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: As you can hear&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: Babies and I was interested in their abilities in relation to other animals</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lab Assistant: Come on, get up we&rsquo;re going to go the monkey room.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So she began the baby development lab which is filled with toys and on any given day five or six really tiny kids</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Interviewer: How old is she?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lab Person #2: She&rsquo;s six months.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Interviewer: And who&rsquo;s this?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: I&rsquo;m a big kid.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Toddlers too.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Interviewer: How old are you?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Three and a half.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Interviewer: Three and a half, big time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So at a certain point Elizabeth Spelke decided to build a version of the white room in this lab cuz she wondered if rats have so much trouble connecting the idea of left to blue, what about uh&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: Surely&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Baby humans.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: A self-respecting eighteen month old human child would succeed in putting them together, but&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: No.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: What we find is that children behave just like the rats.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Just like the rats</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: Just like the rats</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Really</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Just like the rats or almost just like the rats?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: Well we don&rsquo;t test them with food; we don&rsquo;t test them with digging (<em>R. laughing</em>) so in superficial ways, superficial features of the studies are different.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But she says kids, like the rats, cannot connect the idea of left to the idea of blue, they just can&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; And they can&rsquo;t do it at&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: One.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: They can&rsquo;t do it at&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Two</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: They can&rsquo;t do it at three.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Four, five.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: And we find that those children start performing like adults around six years of age.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Now I&rsquo;m interested.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Good</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Something happens at the ripe old age of six.</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: It is shockingly late, right?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Well something happens at the age of six that suddenly allows the kid to connect concepts like left to concepts like blue.&nbsp; And the question is what? What happens?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Several people have suggested that one candidate for a process that&rsquo;s doing this is language.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: What do you mean it&rsquo;s language? Kids are talking, certainly at three, four, five and six. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re talking like, like uh, you know, too much!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: But they&rsquo;re not, what they haven&rsquo;t yet started to use is spatial language, and particularly the kinds of spatial language that adults would use in this situation to describe what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And somewhere around the age of six they start to use phrases like,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Left of the blue wall.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And those aren&rsquo;t just words that come out of the child&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; Liz thinks that inside the child&rsquo;s brain, what that phrase does&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: is link these concepts together,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Clink! And in that moment&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Left of the blue wall!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: The child leaves the rats behind.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: I can&rsquo;t&mdash;are you&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t think that kids have that&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Well let me put it to you a different way.&nbsp; This is my best understanding of what she thinks.&nbsp; Her basic idea is that a child&rsquo;s brain begins as a series of islands.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And on one island way over here, you&rsquo;ve got say color. We can call that the blue   island.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>J &amp; ROBERT KRULWICH: Blue blue, blue&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: That&rsquo;s the part of you that perceives the color blue.&nbsp; Way on the other side of the brain you&rsquo;ve got the part of you that perceives spatial stuff like left.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>J &amp; ROBERT KRULWICH: Left, left, left&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Maybe a third, objects, like wall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>J &amp; ROBERT KRULWICH: Wall, wall, wall&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>These things are there from the beginning, but there separate.&nbsp; Then you get the words left, blue, wall and then the child for the first time comes upon the phrase,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>J &amp; ROBERT KRULWICH: Left of the blue wall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And in that moment all the islands&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kid: Kaboom!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Come together.&nbsp; It is literally the phrase itself, she says, that creates that internal connection.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: Everybody has always talked about how language is this incredible tool for communication that allows us to exchange information with other people so much more richly and affectively than other animals can.&nbsp; But language also seems to me to serve as a mechanism of communication between different systems within a single mind.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: There you go.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Wouldn&rsquo;t it be just as possible, just listen to me here, that the kids brain is developing some new connections and what follows then, follows from the changes in the brain.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So the words are like an after.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Yeah.&nbsp; After.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: After fact?</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: After effect.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Well that&rsquo;s uh, no, no.&nbsp; The experimenters actually accounted for that.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: What the experiments did next is that they thought, okay if language is adding this extra element let&rsquo;s knock it out.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: How would you do that? Would you like shoot something into their brain that kills the language part or something?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Um, there&rsquo;s a much simpler way of doing it and a much more humane (<em>R laughing.</em>) thing you can do.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: What we did is put adults in the room.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And then she says, she gave them an IPod.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: They&rsquo;ve got headphones.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Playing through those headphones is someone talking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: Yep</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And their job, while they&rsquo;re in the room, is to repeat what the person is saying.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: Continuously listening to speech and repeating it the whole time they were in there.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: It&rsquo;s actually a really hard thing to do if you&rsquo;ve ever tried shadowing while someone is speaking.&nbsp; I mean if you tried&mdash;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Can we try it? You go and I&rsquo;ll shadow you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Okay Jad&mdash; JAD ABUMRAD: Okay Jad&mdash; CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: I&rsquo;m going to&mdash; JAD ABUMRAD: I&rsquo;m going to&mdash; CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: try and start speaking now&mdash; JAD ABUMRAD: Start speaking now&mdash; CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: and I want you to say it&mdash;JAD ABUMRAD: and I want you to say it&mdash;CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: right back to me exactly as a I say it&mdash;JAD ABUMRAD: exactly as I say it&mdash;CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: and without any&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Oh my god, that&rsquo;s starting to hurt my head.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s really hard, actually.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Yeah it is hard.&nbsp; And what that does is it knocks out your capacity to use language for yourself</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: Basically battering the words out of the adult&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Why are they doing this again?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Well they wanted to see, like, if you blasted the words out of somebody&rsquo;s head</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: What would happen?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Can they find the biscuit? Will they be able to form that simple thought left of the blue wall or would they be like the rats, who can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And-</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>20 minutes.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: And we actually got really dramatic results.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: They went right back to being like the rats.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Wow.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But Charles, what I&rsquo;m wondering is that if language allows you to construct a though that is so basic as, &ldquo;The biscuit is left of the blue wall,&rdquo; what is thought without language?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: Well I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very much at all.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: What do you mean?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: I&rsquo;m going to put it a different way and this involves making quite a controversial statement.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think very young children do think.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Like think period. (<em>C. laughing.</em>)&nbsp; Was there a period at the end of that sentence?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: I don&rsquo;t think they think in the way I want to call thinking, which is a bit of cheat, but let me say what I mean by thinking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Okay.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CHARLES FERNYHOUGH: If you reflect on your own experience, if you think about what&rsquo;s going on inside your head as you&rsquo;re just walking to work or sitting on a subway train. Much of what&rsquo;s going on in your head at that point is actually verbal.&nbsp; I want to suggest that the central thread of all that is actually language, it&rsquo;s a stream of inner speech.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what most of us think of as thinking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ELIZABETH SPELKE: Well on the other hand what I&rsquo;m most aware of when I&rsquo;m reflecting is the stuff that I can&rsquo;t put into words.&nbsp; I think that he&rsquo;s exaggerating the role of language here.&nbsp; Yes&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: This all really hinges on how you would define thinking, and Liz would say take a musician, like I&rsquo;ll give you my example Bill EvanSusan Schaller: Here is a form of thought that carries you through a definite sequence of phrases, feelings, emotions, changes.

But there are one or two places that he does, in a poem called &ldquo;Lucrece&rdquo;. In which a woman is raped; &ldquo;Lucrece&rsquo;s Rape.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she has to write a letter to her husband explaining what happened to her. And she's struggling to find words in which to do this and finally she picks up the pen and it goElizabeth Spelke: She prepares to write. <em>First hovering o&rsquo;er the paper with her quill; Conceit and grief and eager combat fight; What wit sets down is blotted straight with will; This is too curious good, this blunt and ill.&nbsp; Much like a press of people at a door Throng her inventions, which shall go before.</em>&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll read that couplet again: <em>Much like a press of people at a door Throng her inventions, which shall go before.</em>&nbsp; If you want to extrapolate from this something that Shakespeare might have himself experienced, you have a situation which all these ideas are pressing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like a throng of them.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s getting through that doorway first?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Sound effects, crowd of people.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: It's a little bit maybe like that experience you might have at a nightmare New York club.

What would happen if that throng that is in your head,</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Sound effects, R. laughing.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: What if all of that stuff that is in your head. Suddenly went &ldquo;poof!&rdquo; Got yanked right out of your head.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Hmmmmm&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: What would be left?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Well this got us thinking about a very famous talk at one of the Ted conferences.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: I grew up to study the brain because&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: A talk given by a neuroanatomist named Jill Bolte.&nbsp; Is it Bolte or Bolt?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Bolte.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Bolte Taylor. &nbsp;And all you really need to know is that one morning in December of 1996 Doctor Taylor woke up and she had, she had a headache.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of pain, caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me to experience any kind of, of, pain so I thought okay I'll just start my normal routine. So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio-glider which is a full body full exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought &ldquo;Whoa I&rsquo;m a weird looking thing!&rdquo; So I get off the machine. And I&rsquo;m standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and then I lost my balance I'm propped up against the, the wall. And I'm asking myself what is wrong with me? What is going on? And at that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: In fact a blood vessel in the left hemisphere of Jill&rsquo;s brain had popped.&nbsp; And that part of her brain was starting to shut down.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And it was the shut down that really caught our attention.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: In that moment my brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button. So here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to my to my job it was gone and I felt lighter in my body.&nbsp; And then all of a sudden left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me, &ldquo;Hey! We&rsquo;re having a stroke, we gotta get some help!&rdquo; (<em>Audience laughing.</em>) And I&rsquo;m going: Aaah! I got a problem! I got a problem!&rdquo; So it&rsquo;s like okay I got a problem, but then I immediately drifted right back out.&nbsp; (<em>Audience laughing.</em>) And I affectionately refer to this space as &ldquo;La La Land.&rdquo; So I&rsquo;m just watching my brain become more and more incapable of functioning.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: That is Jill Bolte Taylor herself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: Hi Robert</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: We actually got her into a studio.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: Hello Jad.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Hello. Because we wanted to ask some questions about that moment when her inner voices went away.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: So let&rsquo;s talk about brain chatter for a moment.&nbsp; In the story that we&rsquo;ve told so far your still asking yourself questions. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Now did that stop?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: It, it on the morning of the stroke. I was doing this wafting dance between the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere.&nbsp; So language would come back on. But once I got to the emergency room and I passed out when I woke later that afternoon. I had absolutely no language.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Did you know your name?</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: No.</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: did you know your address?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: No</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Did you know about your summer from 1983.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: No.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: You know like my mom is sitting&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: I didn&rsquo;t know any of that.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: None of it?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: I didn&rsquo;t know any of it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Just imagine she's lying in her bed.&nbsp; Her head is shaved. Wrapped in bandages she's had hours of brain surgery she&rsquo;s got tubes coming out of her mouth, her nose. &nbsp;She's lost her career she's lost her language</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: And I lost all my memories</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: And yet she says sitting there and that's suddenly wordless space&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: I had found a peace inside of myself that I had not known before. I had pure silence inside of my mind.&nbsp; Pure silence.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Pure silence</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: Pure Silence</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: What was&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: You know, not that little voice that you know you wake up in the morning and the first thing your brain says it Oh man the sun is shining. Well imagining you don't hear that little voice that says man the sun is shining you just experience the sun and the shining.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Is this the absence of reflection of any kind? Is it just sensual intake and &ldquo;period?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: That is exactly what it was it was.&nbsp; It was all of the present moment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Did you have thoughts?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JTB: I had joy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>R. laughing.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: I just had joy. I had, I had this magnificent experience of I&rsquo;m this collection of these beautiful cells. I am organic. I&rsquo;m this, this organic entity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Did you have a dead head period by any chance?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: You know why I missed that by a few years, but I get that a lot.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: And, and the other thing that she told us is that lying in that bed without words, she says she felt connected to things, to everything, in a way that she never had before.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: Oh yeah I lost all definition of myself in relationship to everything in the external world.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: You mean like he couldn't figure out where you ended.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: How much of that was about language. &nbsp;A little part? A lot? I mean.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: Oh I would say it was huge.&nbsp; Language is an ongoing information processing it's that constant reminder. I am, this is my name, this is all the data related to me, these are my likes and my &nbsp;dislikes, these are my beliefs, I am an individual, I'm a single, I am a solid, I'm separate from you.&nbsp; This is my name&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Now as fruity as this may all sound to pin all this on language, we have run into this idea before. &nbsp;A couple seasons ago. Paul Brucks, remember him?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Yeah sure.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Neuropsychologist.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>P: Well if you have to ask me about myself&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: He told me that there's a theory out there, which he believes actually, that all a person is in the end.&nbsp; Like all the personhood of a person, the I or the you of a person all that is in the end is a&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>P: Story.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: A story you tell yourself.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>P: What we normally think of when we think about ourselves. Is really a story; it's the story of what's happened to that body over time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: I did not have that portion of my language center that tells a story curious little Jill, me, Jill Bolte Taylor climbing the Harvard ladder, through language, loves dissection, cutting up things, that language was gone. I got to essentially become an infant (<em>baby sounds</em>) again.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: I mean this is the problem here.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: What do you mean?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: When you drop out of the &ldquo;I&rdquo; ness of yourself or the story of yourself then you're left, she says at peace, I could argue that that's just stranded, that's stranded in the sunshine, with the wind in, in the now.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But I mean it&rsquo;s not like she stayed there</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Well that&rsquo;s true.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: I mean we wouldn&rsquo;t be talking to her if she had an as she started to recover she ran into something kinda interesting -- Which sounded to me &nbsp;sort of like what maybe the rats and the babies go through in the white room. She would have these disparate thoughts and then stall out, like she couldn&rsquo;t bring them together.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: Yeah. When, when people would speak to me I would, I remembered in pictures.&nbsp; So if somebody would ask me who's the president of the of the United States of America, this is a huge question. So for the next several hours I'd be pondering president. President. President What&rsquo;s a president? President. And then I would get a picture in my mind of a president as a leader.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Was it a picture of a specific guy?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: It's, it was, actually it's still flashes into my mind. It's, it's a picture of a silhouette of a male.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: A presidential profile.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Like maybe the idea of the president, basically.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Yeah</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So that was her president .</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: And then I had to figure out a United   States. And so eventually come up with this map in my mind, a picture of the United States.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Like a line drawing.&nbsp; So now she&rsquo;s got this map.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got this silhouette of a guy.

Yeah it was Clinton at the time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Now as Jill starts to get better-</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: This after eight years of hard work and recovery&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Finally the words start to trickle back.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And when they did she says, that silence that she loved so much got pushed out.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: That was on of the sacrifices. For me that was a sacrifice.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Well.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: Well.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: (<em>Laughing</em>) We&rsquo;re doing a language show here and you&rsquo;re the anti-queen of our language show! You&rsquo;re like saying who needs it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: No, no, no, no, no. &nbsp;But what I am saying is that in order for us to communicate with language, we pull ourselves away from a different kind of experience. &nbsp;I do believe that there are times when you need to let your brain chatter be quiet.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: But is it fair to say that this is&mdash;please agree or disagree with this statement: I think that words and language and grammar are necessary, but not half as good as wind in my hair, as smell in my nose, and that old right brain sensual immediacy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>40:00</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JILL BOLTE TAYLOR: Yeah, you know if uh, if I had to choose which is essentially what you're saying, if I had to choose&hellip;Um&hellip;that would be really, really, really tough decision.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Bells.

That's where our next story starts. Are you with me?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Ahah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So imagine you&rsquo;re a kid that&rsquo;s deaf, in Nicaragua at this time</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Born deaf?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Born deaf.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Born deaf, okay.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: You&rsquo;ve always been deaf and you&rsquo;re the only one in your family that&rsquo;s deaf.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;re in this situation where everybody's talking there mouths are moving, you can't hear it. And you don't know sign language cuz no one&rsquo;s taught you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: There was no deaf school in Nicaragua then?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Nothing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Okay.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: No deaf education of any kind.&nbsp; So if you were this kid all you've really got our a couple of gestures, really crude gestures you've worked out to talk to your family and friends, but beyond that your cut off.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Like Ildefonso, the guy we met at the beginning of the show, except in Nicaragua in the seventies there were hundreds, maybe thousands of these Ildefonso&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Really?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Yeah. But then everything changes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;In the late seventies Hope Simosa, who was the wife of the then dictator, established a new school for special education.&nbsp; I think she had someone in her family who had a disability not deafness.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But the school would include deaf people and that, says psychology professor Ann Senghas, was a first, because now instead of deaf kids scattered about, they were together, in the same room.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;There were fifty deaf kids in that first entering class</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Preschool to sixth grade.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;In the late seventies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And for most of them this was the first time they ever met another deaf person</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Before the world was going on around them and everyone was all talking and they were cut off from that. And suddenly for the first time they were all there and they were what was happening and they were what there was to talk about.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But they didn&rsquo;t have a way of talking.&nbsp; These were fifty different kids who&rsquo;d never learned a language and had fifty different sets of like rudimentary gestures that they used.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Whoa that must have been&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Yeah like fifty people with fifty different ways to try and&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Ask for breakfast.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Or say they want to go outside. I mean nothing was shared.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;It's not like the teachers were using signs in the classroom. &nbsp;Everything in the class was Spanish.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Which none of them knew.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Copying into their notebooks a lot of it was going right over their heads</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So at the beginning things were completely confusing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;But, they're riding on the bus for an hour everyday, and their playing out at recess for an hour every day, and there getting together at the park</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And no one knows how it happened. Like maybe one of the kids-<br /></p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Who is very charismatic.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: He invented a sign for say ball.&nbsp; He told it to another kid who was very you know socially active and that second kid then spread the sign. &nbsp;However it worked, over time the signs of these fifty kids used,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Started to converge into common system.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And when you step back from all, what that means&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;They created a language.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;They didn't just take it from somewhere else; they couldn't just take it from somewhere else. They created their own.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But how unusual is that?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;This has happened with languages all over the world but not while people were watching. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So what you&rsquo;re saying is this is the first time we've been able to watch a language being born.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Wow.&nbsp; And for the last twenty years that is what Ann has been doing. She&rsquo;s been going to Nicaragua to that school and watching.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>School bell, children playing.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;So uh, oh you wanted to &nbsp;describe the, I may have gotten recording of this, but when you arrive at the school the busses come around. (<em>Sound of bus arriving, children playing.</em>)&nbsp; The kids are all screaming and leaning out the windows and signing to each other and the kids pile out and they line up in rows on the basketball court that&rsquo;s in the center of the schoolyard. And they all sing the national hymn. (<em>National hymn playing.</em>) And the deaf kids all sign the national hymn.&nbsp; And they all have one hand over their heart and sign with the other hand while the hearing kids sing it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Ann visited the school for the first time in 1990 about 10 years after it was formed. She'd been working at the time with a linguist&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Named Judy Kegel.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Studying basic linguist type stuff&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Trying to figure how the verbs work and whether they have agreement with their grammatical objects.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And along the way, her and a collaborator Jennie Pyers stumbled onto something, really surprising, about the power of certain words. So to set it up: When she got there the first time in, to Nicaragua, those original fifty kids who invented this thing had grown up already and there were these younger generations of kids coming in behind them; growing up with the language, using it, inventing new signs. And at a certain point she got curious to just compare the original signers, the older kids, to the younger kids.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: In terms of how they signed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;So we show everyone this old one minute cartoon about this guy who's trying to fly. He sees a bird flying and he puts all these feathers onto his body and he climbs up to the top of the mountain. Flaps his arms and jumps and crashes on the ground</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So she showed deaf kids of different generations this cartoon. And asked them pretty simply to describe&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;What they saw.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Just describe it in sign.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;To describe the whole story.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: The differences were striking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;So um&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: First of all.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;So I'll just show you an example of each.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So you&rsquo;re opening up a movie here.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;So this is a first cohort talking about</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: She got out her laptop and showed me some video. &nbsp;First of this woman in her forties with dark hair and a colorful t-shirt. She was one of the original signers. &nbsp;And when you see older signers like her, describe this guy who&rsquo;s trying to fly, it's really spastic.&nbsp; It's almost like they become the cartoon.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s flapping her hands.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;So&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Moving all around.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;A lot of full body movements. &nbsp;She's talking about someone who&rsquo;s moving in a crazy way, she's gonna be moving in a crazy way. And um&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Then she showed me a young kid who was about eight with a backwards cap</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;So here's Sylvester and now he talks about the manner.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: When he described the man jumping and falling, it was all in the wrist.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;All the movement is now in the hand and it&rsquo;s very&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Stylish</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;You know they're trimming these signs down.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But more to the point, there was one thing she noticed that was really unexpected, had nothing to do with movement.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Couldn't help noticing that they &ndash; the people, different people in the community, talked about different things in this story. The older signers tended to describe all the events in this story.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And only the events.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;And the younger kids.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: They would talk about the guy's feelings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;That this guy was trying to fly wanted to fly but failed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: The kids, she says just seem to be better at-</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Thinking about-</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Thinking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Thinking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Like other people's thinking. So Ann and Jennie decided, let's take all the different generations of deaf kids</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Forty year olds. Thirty year olds. Twenty year olds.&nbsp; Ten year olds.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Let me test them on how well they can think about thinking. So what they did was they showed everybody a comic strip, different from before. &nbsp;This one's about two brothers.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;There's a Big Brother who's playing with the train and the little brother is wanting to play with the train. And the big brother puts it under the bed and goes into the kitchen to eat a sandwich.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And maybe before he goes he looks a little brothers and says, &ldquo;Hey! Don&rsquo;t touch my train, don&rsquo;t touch it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;And then little brother while the big brother is out of the room takes the train out and hides it in the toy box. And then the big brother comes back and the question is where's the big brother going to go to find his train. Is he going to look under the bed or is he going to look in the toy box?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>50:00</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Well he's gonna look under the bed</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Yep</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Because as far as he knows that&rsquo;s where he left it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;He didn't see it move.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And if you ask kids over the age of five most of them would say he&rsquo;s gonna look under the bed because that&rsquo;s where he left it and he doesn't know that it's been moved to the toy box. But here's the thing, when she asked the older signers-</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;They would say oh look in the toy box.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Really?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;They would pick the wrong one. &nbsp;These are thirty-five year olds.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: 35 year olds would get this wrong?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;They would fail this test, yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Seven out of eight, she says.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;And then all of younger signers that we worked with passed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: At this point she's just confused.&nbsp; Like why would this be? Why can't the older people pass the simple test that involves thinking about someone else is thinking? What's going on here? And then it occurred to her, it might have something to do with certain words, because the older signers they don't really have so many words. For the concept of-</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Thinking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: I mean they have mainly just one sign pointing at your forehead.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Basically you just point at your forehead with your index finger. &nbsp;But by the time you get to the younger kids. They've got tons of words for thinking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Things like, I know something and I know that you don't know it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: I know something and I know you do know it. They&rsquo;ve got a sign for understand, believe.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Believe, remember, forget.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: How many roughly were there?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Ten or twelve. Wow! So from thirty years we go from just a couple to&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;We went from knowing and not knowing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: To twelve?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And somehow that makes all the difference. &nbsp;She says the more of these &ldquo;think words&rdquo; you've got. The more you can think. Am I right to say that? You&rsquo;re tiptoeing toward that</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But maybe you don't want to go there all the way?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Yeah I&rsquo;m trying to think that&mdash;I guess I, I don't think it's so simple that you could just go in and say hey I&rsquo;m going to teach you ten signs today and now suddenly you're gonna have better cognitive capacity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But you are saying though that the verb, think&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Ahuh.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Is somehow implicated in my ability to think about your thinking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Right.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Thinking about thinking. Understanding how other people understand. That's something that having language makes you better at.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: There are certain words she says that don&rsquo;t just give you a name for something; somehow they give you access to a concept that would otherwise be really hard to get or even talk about. It's really hard to talk about thoughts, without the word thoughts.&nbsp; Or what is time without the word time? It&rsquo;s a really freaking hard concept. These words are like bridges. Somehow they get you to some new mental place that otherwise you&rsquo;d be cut off from. But that&rsquo;s sad though these young kids have something that the people who actually invented the language don&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;But we went back two years later, tested the same people. And then suddenly some of them were performing a lot better than they had the two years before on the same kinds of tasks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: You mean the older signers?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Yeah</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: They were passing suddenly?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Some of them were passing, yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: What happened?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;What happened in the past two years?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Yeah!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Those younger kids grew up and started hanging out at the deaf association.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Wait what?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;(<em>Laughing</em>.) So what had happened in the mean time&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So here's the strange twist to the whole thing: the death association is this place where the older signers would hang out.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Yeah it&rsquo;s a social club.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: So they&rsquo;d play chess, do whatever. Well at a certain point these youngsters start showing up, you know, cuz they&rsquo;ve graduated and they wanna hang out at the deaf association too. But they bring with them, all of their new</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;Mental verbs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: You know all these words for thinking. They start using it with the older kids. &nbsp;The older kids pick it up. Suddenly these older kids are now passing the test!</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;So there was learning that took place in adulthood that actually gives them new insight into other people's thinking and motivation and now they can pass these tasks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: That&rsquo;s super interesting</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ANN SENGHAS: &nbsp;So that's the story. It's really cool.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(<em>Music.</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Ann Senghas is an associate professor of psychology at Barnard College in New York.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: The thing of course is you wonder once you've gotten these this new facility in you&hellip; There's a lot of literature about this, &ldquo;My Fair Lady&rdquo; is about this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: &ldquo;My Fair Lady&rdquo; is about this?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Yeah. It's about a woman who learns proper English and she can no longer be a flower girl in Covent Garden.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s now a lady.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Oooohhhh yeah, I guess it is kind of like this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: You wonder, like remember our program began with that the story of Ildefonso?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Right which he heard from Susan Schaller. Ildefonso was the guy who, for 27 years, had no language, at all.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: So you kind of wonder like what happened to Ildefonso once he got language</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Right and after that first breakthrough where Ildefonso realized things have names, Susan ended up leaving for a few years.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;it was about four years, I think, four or five.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: But then she decided to write a book about him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: And so I went and found him again.&nbsp; And he had language and I could ask him all kinds of questions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Were you able then to sit down with him and ask him about his life and really get the, sort of his biography?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Some what, some what. One area that everyone wants to know about is what it was like to be languageless.&nbsp; You know, what was going on in his head</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: And I asked and I asked. And I asked.&nbsp; And he starts telling me that was the dark time in his life. Learning language is like the lights went on and I tell him well we know about language and we want to know what it&rsquo;s like not to have language and he doesn't wanna talk about it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: But there was a day she says when she was writing the book and she met Ildefonso in a restaurant and there he was sitting with his brother Mario, who should never met before. And she quickly learned that Mario also was deaf.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: And languageless.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Really?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: So I was shocked and because I was so amazed going I can't believe you have a languageless brother, that's when Ildefonso said &ldquo;Well let, let me introduce you to some of my friends.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: So they get in the car and they drive for awhile we stop at this apartment.&nbsp; We walk into this small little room and there were these six Mexican men doing this mime routine.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Wait all of these guys were like Ildefonso use to be?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: They had no language.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Wow.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: They were all deaf and they didn&rsquo;t know they were deaf.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: And what, what were they doing?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: One man would stand up and he would start miming.&nbsp; He would just start acting out a bull fight.&nbsp; So he&rsquo;d be the bull and he&rsquo;d be charging and then he&rsquo;d be the matador and then he&rsquo;d be somebody in the crowd watching. And then he would add a detail.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: For example&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: A hat.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: And then they would swap so then another guy would get up to take over the story.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Then they&rsquo;d start miming.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: They&rsquo;d reenact the matador, describe the hat, but now the second storyteller would add a new detail.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Like another person with a pair of glasses or something.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: So each one would stand up take the bullfight, the same bullfight to a different point and add a detail?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Exactly, exactly.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Oh my God.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: In other words it would take them maybe 45 minutes to say, &ldquo;Do you remember the time when we were at the bullfight and this woman did such and such?&rdquo; It was like drawing a picture.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ROBERT KRULWICH: Let me ask you a pull it altogether question. &nbsp;I was about to think that what a language is, is a great connector, but this last story makes me wonder. These are five men really sharing and connecting on details, so is the difference that language makes just efficiency or does it affect your heart or your whole way of? &nbsp;I can't tell I'm not sure anymore.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SUSAN SCHALLER: Well I'm getting Ildefonso&rsquo;s answer, which, when I saw him a couple of years later, after this incident, I asked him about his friends and he said he couldn't talk to them anymore. He, he wasn't willing to go through that tedious effort of all the miming anymore. But the interesting thing that he said is that he can&rsquo;t even think that way anymore. (<em>Music.</em>) He said he can't think the way he used to think and when I pushed him to ask about what it was like to be languageless, the closest he ever came to any kind of an answer was exactly that. I don't know, I don't remember. I think differently now.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JAD ABUMRAD: Susan Schaller author of the book, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">A Man without Words</span>.

But when her son Alex was in a bad car accident, she decided to stay home to help him recover. And then, rather suddenly, she decided to quit science altogether and become a full-time artist. After that, her husband <span>Robert Adams</span> tells us, she just painted and painted and painted. First houses and buildings, then a series of paintings involving strawberries, and then ... \"Bolero.\"</p>\n<p>At some point, Anne became obsessed with Maurice Ravel's famous composition and decided to put an elaborate visual rendition of the song to canvas. She called it \"Unraveling Bolero.\" But at the time, she had no idea that both she and Ravel would themselves unravel shortly after their experiences with this odd piece of music. <span>Arbie Orenstein</span> tells us what happened to Ravel after he wrote \"Bolero,\" and neurologist <span>Bruce Miller</span> helps us understand how, for both Anne and Ravel, \"Bolero\" might have been the first symptom of a deadly disease.</p>\n<p> <em>Support Radiolab today at <a href=\"https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab-it/onestep/?utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=notes&amp;utm_campaign=membership&amp;utm_content=radiolab\" target=\"_blank\">Radiolab.org/donate</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Read more:</p>\n<p><a title=\"Unravelling Bolero\" href=\"http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/1/39.full\" target=\"_blank\">Unravelling Bolero: progressive aphasia, transmodal creativity and the right posterior neocortex</a></p>\n<p>Arbie Orenstein's <a title=\"Ravel: Man and Musician\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ravel-Musician-Dover-Books-Music/dp/0486266338/ref=la_B001HCY5JC_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340121834&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Ravel: Man and Musician</a></p>",

I mean, on the surface, she was just painting, and it was working. People were buying the paintings. She was having solo shows. She was becoming a successful artist.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But then in 1994-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>She decided...

Two panels side-by-side. Very electric colors.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>A blizzard of symbols and triangles and little tooth-type things with marks on them that all mean something, and rectangles marching-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Back and forth across the first panel.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>There was a triangle in the bottom of each one of the rectangles, and the height of the rectangle represented the loudness.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It's an incredibly obsessive translation of the music into visual language. And just like the melody in Bolero, the symbols repeat and repeat and repeat, obsessively getting bigger and bigger and bigger until at the very end of the second panel, things unravel.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>By the way, her title for the painting was Unraveling Bolero.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And that unraveling, turns out it happened before.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>When we come back, we're going to, um, we're going to explain what we mean by a rhyme.

Story number two. Well, okay, should we jump in?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Yeah, please.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This is Arbie Orenstein.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Professor of music at the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>He's written about Ravel, performed Ravel, talked to anyone who ever knew Ravel.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Uh, he kind of is a, what shall I say, a kind of a living presence inside my head.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>So, okay, Maurice Ravel is a composer, obviously, one of the greats.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Born in 1875. Papa was an engineer. Mother was from an old Bosque family.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>As in, she was Spanish?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Yes.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Which is why, uh, some of his music, like Bolero, does sound a bit Spanish.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In any case, mom encourages him to study music. He goes off to Paris in the 1890s, meets Claude Debussy, and together they sort of invent this style of music which we now call Impressionism, which was this kind of-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Free-floating, almost dreamlike, sensuous, a lot of colors.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Very flowery.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Yes.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But then, like Anne , Ravel makes a kind of shift.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>1928-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>When he was 53, about the same age Anne was when she did the painting-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Ravel is having an absolutely phenomenal year.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Just toured the United States, performed for thousands.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>He's at the zenith of his creativity.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And he's back in France at a beach house-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Wearing a pink bathing suit.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And story goes, right before he steps out onto the beach, this melody swoops into his head. He runs over to the piano-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Takes his index finger, and he goes, da, dun-dun-di-dun-di-dun, dun, dun-dun-dun. There it was.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It just came to him fully-formed?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Well, he... I don't know if he played the whole melody, but he at least started it off.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But here's the shift. When he sat down to flesh the whole thing out, instead of developing the melody, making it super flowery like his other stuff, he decided, \"No, I'm not going to do that. I'm gonna take this melody and repeat it again and again and again. And then again some more. And then some more.\"</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The theme never changes one note.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The only thing that does change is the orchestration, which grows around the melody.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Very slowly.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bit by bit, it gets bigger, bigger.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>More accompaniment. More instruments play the melody.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But the melody itself for 340 bars never varies to the point, he says, where the performers-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>They're ready to see a psychiatrist by the time they're done playing this piece. And Ravel, at the first performance in Paris, some woman screamed out, \"He's crazy!\"</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Which turned out to be, well, not exactly true, but in the neighborhood. Six years after he wrote Bolero, this is 1933, Ravel begins to forget words. He'd always been forgetful so no one really noticed at first. But then one day at dinner, he grabs the knife by the wrong side.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And he doesn't realize it.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And he continues to try to eat.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Holding the sharp side of the knife and trying to cut with the handle.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Then he visits a friend, leaves-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Not two hours go by, knock on the door, it's Ravel again. He didn't remember that he'd been there before.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Just two hours earlier.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Eventually-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>By 1935-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>He could not write any more.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Or speak. His language had evaporated. Arbie says there are documents where you can see Ravel desperately trying to relearn the alphabet.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>A... A... A... A... Over and over again.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Wow.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>B... B...

Flag.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And, uh, that four or five words would come out over about a minute's time. She was very frustrated.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Both Anne Adams and Maurice Ravel were unraveling in the exact same way at the exact same speed to the same soundtrack, you might say. But just, roughly 60 years apart.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>We think he and Anne, down to the very molecular process had the exact same disease.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And he thinks Bolero, the music and then the painting, in both their cases, was the first symptom of that disease.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This takes a couple of steps to explain. Bear with me.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But to start, the disease is called frontotemporal dementia, and it's... It begins when certain cells in your frontal cortex, which is sort of above your forehead, begin to wither away, in some cases literally leaving holes in your frontal cortex. And we know this about Anne from tests and brain scans. We suspect it about Ravel because, according to Arbie, just before he died-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>On December 28th, 1937-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>A French surgeon opened up his skull and saw...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Arbie Orenstein:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>That one of the lobes of the two lobes of the brain had sunk.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Because it was disintegrating.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Now in both of their cases, the part of their brain, the part of their cortex that got hit, was on the left. It was the part of the brain that does a lot of things, has a lot to do with memory, but most importantly for our story, this is the part of your brain that largely governs language. And what you see is that people who suffer from frontotemporal dementia, they lose their words. They can no longer string words together.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And here's the thing about losing something like language. It has all kinds of other effects in the brain because, according to Bruce, our brain is a series of interconnected circuits. And when in a normal brain, a dominant circuit like language turns on, it is basically wired to turn a bunch of other circuits off. It basically goes, \"Shh\" to other parts of the brain.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[crosstalk 00:18:21] We have this constant dance where one circuit or many circuits turn on and then they're obligatorily turning off other circuits.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>So language acts as a kind of brake on other things that the brain can be doing, like daydreaming, thinking in pictures.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But when the language is no longer there to hold things back, often what happens is that those other parts, like say the visual parts, can rush forward. And suddenly the mind is just flooded with images, and you hear reports of people having these intensely visual experiences they- they've just got to express.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This is very common. We see a number of patients who become visually-obsessed.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>He says he sees, you know, investment bankers who've never shown any interest in art-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Never even walked into an art museum.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>All of a sudden, they decide in their 50s, \"Well, I'm going to move into a loft, take up painting.\"</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>That's right.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>How many of these cases have you seen?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>50, 60. Uh, some of them have sculpted, some of them have painted. [crosstalk 00:19:17]</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>He's said he's seen people talk up gardening, graphic design, and what so many of the cases have in common is that the sort of visual creativity that bursts forth, it's not the free-flowing kind. It's very mechanical.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The repetition, the obsession.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>They get stuck in a kind of loop, taking one visual idea and doing it again and again and again like an Anne Adams painting or...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bolero.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This, uh, drive to repeat happens very early in the course of this illness.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>So he says, what can seem like a simple creative choice to repeat a melody may actually be driven by a condition that you won't even know you have for six years.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>We think that this had something to do with the very unusual rhythmic, repetitive sorts of music that Ravel produced.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>I asked Bruce, so why the repetition? Where does... Where does that come from?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Um...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And, um-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>I think this is the release of, uh, of [crosstalk 00:20:16]</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>He says that we don't really know.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>... programs, so I, I think that [crosstalk 00:20:18]</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But he offered up a theory which I find fascinating, which may get to the root of creative obsession of any kind.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>He says there might be several parts of the brain that are held back by the language circuit, and one of them is this very ancient part of the brain.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The basal ganglia, the part of the brain we move with [crosstalk 00:20:39]</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>You can call it our \"reptile brain.\" This is the part of us that, uh, governs, you know, basic behaviors like eating, running.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Motor programs, that uh, we, uh, do repetitively every day.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It's all it does. It send commands saying, \"Move, move, eat, eat, run, run.\" Birds and snakes get by with basically just this part of the brain. It keeps them alive.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Now, normally, he thinks the language part of us-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Inhibits these habits, these repetitive motor programs that [crosstalk 00:21:05]</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But when the language part of the brain is not there to do the shushing, these motor commands filter up too.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>So imagine you're one of these people. Your mind is flooded with all of these images, maybe sounds. It's also flooded with all of these kinetic, repetitive instructions. Move, move, move, do it again, and in the early stages of the illness, you still have enough brain to make sense of it all.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>There's still a lot of cortex that is still available to act upon this desire to repeat. [crosstalk 00:21:34]</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And so you get art that is obsessive and repetitive, but also beautiful and abstract, like Anne's painting Unraveling Bolero.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But then, Bruce says, as the disease progresses and more of that sort of cortex-y, human-y part fades away-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The repetition becomes much simpler.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In the latter stages of a disease, he says you'll often see patients-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Pouring water into a cup 100 times in a day, squishing ants over and over again. The complexity of the behaviors are diminishing as we're losing these, uh, parts of the brain that make us so human.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This is sort of what you see in Anne's work. Her paintings start off simple, explode into abstraction, and then get simple again.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But what's unusual compared to the other patients is that she kept painting almost all the way to the end.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Until literally, it was not possible for her to, to hold and direct a brush or a pen.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>That's her husband Robert again.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Bruce Miller:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Anne became progressively paralyzed on the right side of her body.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>She lost the ability to paint, 2005, early. And that, that, that was sad.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Towards the end, he says he would go into her studio.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And I would see her there-</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In front of a blank canvas.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And she wouldn't be doing anything. She would just be looking at it. And I'd come back a couple of hours later, and she'd still wouldn't have done anything.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>She had lost the ability to do the art.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And that, to me, is one of the, I dare say, beautiful parts of Anne's story. That the drive to create is as primal as anything else in the body. That even after she couldn't eat, after she could barely swallow, she still sat there in her studio, trying to paint.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>She had gone downhill so far by that time that, uh, that, uh, she was hardly recognizable as, as herself.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>At some point in the disease, and you can see that in this early tape, painting was really all she had.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Anne Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>I, I don't have the, the memories of this.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 13:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It was basically all she was.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 13:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Can you tell me what your job is? Are you, are you still working?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Anne Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Uh, I do art.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 13:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Great.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>She died in 2007?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Adams:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Yes, in January of 2007.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Almost exactly 60 years after Maurice Ravel.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Thanks to Robert Adams, Bruce Miller at the University of California, San Francisco, and Arbie Orenstein at Queens College.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Well, that's a song that's not...

Until it wasn't. Their story raises questions that, until recently, no parent had to face… and that are still nearly impossible to answer.</p>\n<p>This hour, we spend the entire episode on the story of Kelley and Tom, whose daughter was born at 23 weeks and 6 days, roughly halfway to full term. Their story contains an entire universe of questions about the lines between life and death, reflex and will, and the confusing tug of war between two basic moral touchstones: doing no harm...and doing everything in our power to help. <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2012/reports/juniper/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelley has written about her experience in a brilliant series of articles in the Tampa Bay Times</a>.

I'm Jad Abumrad.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm Robert Krulwich.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Radiolab and today a story about a decision.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a decision that we as human beings, we've only recently begun to consider.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, sure there are stories like this elsewhere, but somehow-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not too many.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe not.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we're going to devote the entire hour to just this one story, which I think is a first for us.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think it is. And the story comes to us from a woman named Kelly Benhnam. She's a reporter for the Tampa Bay Times in Florida. Maybe the way to do this chronologically, just sort of across time, where were you and who, what did you want to do?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I decided to have a baby?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where you one of those people who ever since you were young, you knew that you would be a mom.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I did, but I wasn't like... I didn't play with a lot of dolls or babysit. But I always just kind of had this weird certainty that might have a daughter.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a daughter and not a son.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe a son too, but I don't know. I think I always thought I would have a daughter and I sort of had this image of her in my head.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what was the image?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Really Feisty, mischievous, dark hair, dirty face.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. We've left princess land now.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a princess at all. A tree climber and a dog chaser. I really wanted to have a baby. I wanted one very badly.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I just couldn't see how it made sense for me to be the father.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's Tom French, also a journalist at the Tampa Bay Times or he was at the time he and Kelly had been dating for a few years, but he was a good 10 years older than her.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had two kids, sons approaching the end of college and I was ready to travel. I wanted to see as Spain and Greece and-</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world tour on the cruise ship where you get to be the, you know, poker master, whatever you family-</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only world tour I would have been insured with Springsteen.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Springsteen.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following Springsteen around Europe. I'd made up my mind no more kids, but she was insistent.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stuck to it.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She saw our daughter very clearly.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And saw that I was destined to be that little girl's father.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And was that a happy gentle disagreement or the other kind?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, it was brutal. Broke up. And when we worked at the same place, there was kind of an invisible line in the newsroom that neither of us would cross.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The line was the mailboxes.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There really was line. Wow. Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a horrible time. We call it the dark era.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark period.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What turned you?</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the Halloween section of Target. My sons and I have loved Halloween forever. I love it when I was a little kid and I just wanted to see what they have. They had anything new because I had, you know, I usually check out their gargoyles and their stuff. And so I just was kind of walking through the section browsing and then something just stop me in my tracks.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently it was, it was really like kind of a lightning bolt epiphany.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I just said, wait a minute, maybe you are not thinking about the straight, you're acting as though you're 80. And then it hit me that nobody knows how much time they have. To have a child is to embrace a future that you can't control, remember those words. So I had this come to Jesus meeting with myself among the gargoyles and that was when I realized I need to just take a step back and try to restart the conversation with Kelly.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so then he, you know, went home and wrote me this long letter and I just, I was over in by that point I was like, I wasn't looking back. So you know, over a few months.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it took a little while. They patched things up, eventually got married and started trying to make a baby.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We thought that this would just happen right away. And then of course it didn't,</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After trying and trying-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The regular way.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drugs that make you drop a bunch of eggs at one time.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Turkey based or method, there's like kind of a process that they walk you through.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Turkey baster-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IVF.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test tube stuff.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. And I never thought that it would get that far.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it would go farther because after trying IVF.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three times.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That didn't work.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they said, well, you can try it with an egg donor.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meaning you get a friend who'd be willing to donate the egg, take the egg, put it in the dish, forcibly impregnated with Tom's sperm, then you insert the egg into your womb.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's kind of the magic bullet it seems in fertility is kind of like if you don't know what's wrong with your car, you just replace the whole engine.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelly asked a good friend to be an egg donor or they've been planted the egg and shortly after she took a pregnancy test.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tested away too early. And so the line was super, super faint, wasn't even sure I could see it at all. So I took a photograph of the pregnancy test and I put it into Photoshop and I actually to dial up the contrast to make the line appear.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is everything about this is so high tech. Right.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow. And what did you see what you wanted to see?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, and I was like, \"Oh my God I think there's two lines there.\" So I waited and I and I did it a second time, and then I then I told Tom.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did you go into like the expectant parent mode and-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh yeah. You touched up to paint. You know, I patched the little holes in the wall. Everything was perfect. Everything was absolutely perfect until it wasn't.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; five months into her pregnancy, 20 weeks, which is just about halfway cause a full term is 40. Kelly was at a park playing with her dog.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I just, I felt a little bit weird and just started to bleed like not a lot, but any amount of blood, it's not a good thing. And I called the doctor's office and they didn't seem too concerned. They were like, yeah, you probably want to go to the hospital and get that check.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I went to pick her up. Then by the time we got to the hospital, she was in a lot of pain.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cramping, cramping, cramping. I knew something was really, really wrong. They got me into one of those wheelchairs and they wheeled me into the sort of triage room. And by that point, like blood was just coming out of me, chunks of blood coming out of me and I didn't know, I thought it was baby parts like falling out and I thought I'm having a miscarriage. Like the babies kind of drop out on the floor. I was throwing up and then the doctor came in and he looked scared.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the doctor say something or what happened?</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor explained to me quietly there was something that was making it difficult to stop Kelly's bleeding. And if they couldn't stop it, we might lose Kelly, and Kelly heard the doctor say this, and I need to tell you, Kelly is the toughest, most fearless person I've ever known. But she grabbed my arm as hard as anyone who's ever grabbed my arm.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I remember just asking him, don't let me die.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don't let me die. It was terrifying.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then at some point they, they brought in an ultrasound machine to see what was going on with the baby. And I assumed the baby was long dead and I thought there were baby parts on the floor. I didn't know. And they hooked up this machine and they were moving around and around and around and trying to pick up a heartbeat and there was nothing. And I was apologizing to Tom. I'm sorry, like, you know, I just knew the baby was gone then all of a sudden [inaudible 00:08:50] there, it was just its heart beat.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is sound she recorded on her cell phone.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baby's heartbeat. Super, super fast. So it sounds like a rabbit or something.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You just hear it on the Sonogram.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, this heartbeat pops up and then there's the baby and you can see her and she looks fine. She's totally oblivious where she's just right there. So now I thought, \"oh my God, I'm going to watch her die. I'm gonna Watch her die in front of me.\" And then they started just pumping me full of drugs to try to get this labor stopped. There's this drug called magnesium sulfate and one of the effects of it is it just makes you kind of boil from the inside.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But eventually they got the contractions stop. They got the bleeding stopped. They put me in a hospital room and they said get to 24 weeks cause that's, that's the limit.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So four more weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. It was almost like they drawn a line in the sand like you must get to 24 or there's no hope.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why 24 what's special about then that number?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They told me that, 24 weeks is kind of the loose definition of viability that sort of grew out of when they were fighting out Roe V Wade.</p>\r\n<p>Speaker 8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In [inaudible 00:10:26] verses [inaudible 00:10:26] for example, the court ruled that a woman who commits an abortion on herself is guilty of no crime.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. So here's the story as I understand it Robert. In Roe V Wade, the supreme court was trying to strike this balance. They wanted to protect a woman's right to choose as we know. But they also wanted to say that there are limits to that. That there is some moment in the development of the fetus and the course of this pregnancy. Will you cross this line and suddenly it's no longer just about the woman's rights. Now you have to think about the state's interest in the unborn child.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem of course is weird you draw that line.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that is the million dollar question.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Nita Farahany. She's a law professor at Duke University.</p>\r\n<p>Nita Farahany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the kind of best gas at that point, the best medical objective standard that the justices could come up with.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is in 1973.</p>\r\n<p>Nita Farahany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was viability.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the word viable in this case means can it survive on its own?</p>\r\n<p>Nita Farahany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, outside of the woman's womb.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, when a fetus is developed enough that you can take it out of the mother's womb and it can still survive that the court suggested is the point when it is no longer okay to have an abortion.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of across that line a fetus-</p>\r\n<p>Nita Farahany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is viable.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So then the question was, when does a fetus cross that line? When can it survive on its own?</p>\r\n<p>Speaker 11:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we begin the [inaudible 00:11:46] in our brains development of the human embryo.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here's where you get to the 24 week thing. What ended up happening was that the court considered what was known about fetal development, and there are charts that show this to go like this, three weeks-</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fetus's brain and heart begin to develop.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight weeks nerve fibers.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13 to 16 weeks, the fetus begins to move and then kick.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 23 weeks. Some fetuses respond to familiar sounds like a mother's voice.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at 24 weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Air sacks form in the lungs. And the thinking was maybe that's the point, the minimum point where the fetus is viable because perhaps it could breathe on its own. But this was just a theoretical idea. No one was testing it.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one was trying to take the fetus out of a mother at 24 weeks to see if it would survive.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, throughout the 70s and 80s most hospitals, according to Kelly drew the line of viability back a little bit farther at 28 weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is because somewhere around the 28th week of gestation, the lungs start to produce a fluid called surfactant, which prevents the lungs from collapsing and sticking together between breaths. So that's a really important thing.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So for a long time, the actual viability line, not the theoretical one, was 28 weeks, but then in the late seventies-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone invented an artificial lung surfactant. It's kind of a slippery white stuff that they shoot down the ventilator tube and the baby's born. And that combined with Ivy Nutrition.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New super small ventilators.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moved the line of viability back to around where it is now.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it is now is generally around 24 but here's the thing, depending on what hospital you're in, even what doctor is on call, sometimes it can be 23 or 25 or in some cases 22.</p>\r\n<p>Nita Farahany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So given modern technology.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You could imagine says Nita one day the line could jump way back, which will make things really tricky.</p>\r\n<p>Nita Farahany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, for example, we get to the point where modern science is able to develop an artificial womb. Yeah. Does viability start at the point of a fertilized egg? You know, if the standard is the point at which the developing child can actually survive outside of the womb using any technological intervention possible, that is a slippery line indeed.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They said get to 24 weeks because that's the limit.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which meant that the doctors had the pump Kelly full of drugs, keep her feet elevated for at least another four weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I just kept going into labor in and out of it and they felt like they couldn't hold it off anymore.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at 23 weeks and four days, a doctor tells her that there's nothing more they can do. The baby is going to come in a day, maybe two.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guy comes in and he seems a little uncomfortable like this. It was not pleasant for him. He said, you know, your baby's probably coming in 24 to 48 hours and we know how hard you work to have this baby and we know how much you want this baby and we assume that you want everything done. What does that mean? We had no idea. So we said, \"We're not sure if we do want everything done. Paint the picture for us doctor.\"</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he said, you know, there's about a 53% chance that the baby will die no matter what we do.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 53.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever we do.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever we do, there was a small chance that she could be fine.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what were those chances?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 20. I felt like like 20% you know it's not an impossibility. It seems like a reasonable... it seems like worth a gamble until you really think about what the 80% means. I mean she could be on a ventilator for the rest of her life. She could have a massive bleed in her brain and there was like eat holes in her brain and affect her ability to think or talk or walk.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could pretty good chance she could be blind or deaf. And there was no way for the doctors to predict.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what the doctors did know is that when the baby came into the world it would need a ton of medical support. It may even need to be revived. And so the question for Tom and Kelly was, do they want the doctors to do that? Do they want them to pursue every measure possible? or no? And just let nature take its course.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he said we should decide before the baby came because once the baby came, if we saw the baby, it would be really hard to say no. So if no one's going to be the answer, we need to just say that before the baby came.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the worst night ever. You're trying to make up your mind about what's right.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like would we be torturing this baby for nothing?</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We didn't want her to be born and have a life that you would hate us for having.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been instances where children with birth defects or genetic diseases have filed wrongful life suits, essentially claiming that they should have never been born.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had to really debate what was in her best interests, what would she want?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started to really struggle with whether I was being selfish, whether I had already pushed too far and this was like God or the universe pushing back. That we would end up losing our house or marriage might break up. We would lose our ability to try again for another child. I felt like I might get a baby, but I would lose everything else. And I think I got pretty close to no.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All night as we're talking this through and crying and trying to figure it out. We could hear the baby's heartbeat to the Monitor. Baby was letting us know all night. I'm right here. I'm right here.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there must've been a moment where you had to say yes or no out loud.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well we asked for a second opinion or not a second opinion, but another console. We had some more questions and at nurse practitioner from the NICU came to the room.</p>\r\n<p>Diane:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Diane [Lowisell 00:18:27]. I'm a neonatal nurse practitioner.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the next day.</p>\r\n<p>Diane:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had asked to speak to someone again.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And instead of just citing numbers and statistics.</p>\r\n<p>Diane:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't give numbers. It's different for each baby.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She kind of started to paint a picture. \"This is what I've seen. I've been doing this 30 years.\"</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But more importantly.</p>\r\n<p>Diane:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also told them that it wasn't a yes or no decision.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, you know, you don't have to decide right now.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They could have the baby.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The baby came out crying and active than we should do everything-</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the baby.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if the baby came out, blue and limp</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intraventricular hemorrhage, we could stop. We didn't have to keep going.</p>\r\n<p>Diane:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If something goes horribly wrong, we can withdraw the support, then you could hold your baby until it dies. But you can give your baby a chance and see how it goes.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, in a very real way, they could give this decision to the baby.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That same night I was feeling like I'm just uncomfortable.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple hours later, discomfort turns to pain.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally a doctor came in and was like, \"Yeah, you're in labor and we have to go right now.\" So then it was like super, super quick. Oh, our light shot in the spine, cutting me open and then, oh my God, there's a third person in this room. But not really. Not Quite, almost. I mean, she was so, so early.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what did she look like?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I didn't see her then. I just saw like her kind of Whiz by in an incubator and she just thought I got a little dark, smear it a hat.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did you make it to 24 weeks?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we were one day shy of 24.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23 weeks and six days.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you'd like to see more of this story that you've been listening to we've actually made a short film which you can find@radiolab.org/23weeks.

Kelly Benham a journalist published an unbelievably wonderful set of articles about her and her husband, Tom French, who was also a journalist. They had a baby except their baby came very, very early. So full term, as we've mentioned, is 40 weeks. Their daughter arrived 23 weeks and six days, which works out to be just a little bit over halfway.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. Just to put that in context. If the baby is born before 22 weeks, it's generally considered a miscarriage and pretty much no doctor is going to intervene if a baby is born after 25 weeks. They've been all kinds of studies which show that doctors then feel morally obliged to save that life no matter what the parents say.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So before 22 and after 25 things are pretty clear, but between 22 and 25, you land in this gray zone. This strange little liminal space between life and death. We have to answer some really tough questions.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like should my baby live at what cost?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And who gets to decide.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ultimately when does life begin?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she has shown us that so many-</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelly and Tom, like many parents who land in this zone decided that for the hardest question.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately it's up to the baby.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The baby will tell them whether it's going to stay or whether it's going to go.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they delivered by C-section and their daughter who at that point didn't have a name, was whisked off to the neonatal intensive care unit or the NICU. And eventually they went to see her.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they incubator her.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she was like weirdly perfect. She had all the parts, these long fingers and long feet, delicate little nose and she had hair and fingernails and eyebrows and you know, all the things that they're supposed to have. But she was translucent. You can just see right through or you could see all the veins running under her skin and you could see her heart thumping in her chest. And her eyes were sealed shut like a puppy and she was like, beat up.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like she had bruises all over her body and she had a black eye just from the, you know, they are very careful with them when they're born, but just that very delicate handling, kind of batters these babies because they're so fragile. I mean, it was like weird. Like I didn't know how I was supposed to feel. I mean, you want to believe that the, the minute you meet your daughter, there's going to be like butterflies, you know, are like Unicorns or something. It's supposed to be the best moment of your life. But there was so much terror inside that moment.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was terrified because I love being a father. My relationship with my sons is extremely important to me, and I was really terrified that she would be so alien having been born at 23 weeks, six days, that I wouldn't recognize her as my daughter and that I wouldn't bond with her, that I was now that thought was filled new with a real dread. And I went up to see her. I could see that she was only half finished, barely a pound at that point. So tiny my brain couldn't even process how small she was.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the nurse Gwen she said, well, you can touch her, you know, and I was stunned because I didn't think I wouldn't be able to. And so she had me, I had already washed and sterilized my hands once and she had me do it again. She showed me how to reach in through this little round porthole into the incubator and explained how to touch her. You, you don't rub the skin because the skin will come off if you do that. When they're born that early you, you just press gently.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the baby was lying there, not with her fists, but with her arms extended with their palms open. So her right palm was right there when I reached my left hand in and I just put my left finger gently into her poem and she just grabbed on tight. And in that moment all my fears about not being able to bond with her washed away. And what got to me was how I could be so afraid when she was so strong. And at that point I just... she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. And I told her, I told her, \"Hey peanut, it's daddy.\" So that's when I meet my daughter,</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a baby is this early, the parents and the doctors are watching it very carefully. Trying to guess, is this baby ready to be out in the world? Is it going to make it? And Tom says when she grabbed his finger that wasn't just them bonding. He felt like she was saying something to him.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She made her will very, very clear.</p>\r\n<p>Diane:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Baby declared itself like declared its will to live.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that was a phrase we heard again and again.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some babies will... can use the term, declare themselves over the first few hours and days of their life.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a neonatologist we spoke to, Keith Barrington.</p>\r\n<p>Diane:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You get a gut feeling.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's Diane [inaudible 00:30:16] again, the nurse practitioner.</p>\r\n<p>Diane:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After meeting the baby that this one looks very fragile or this one can do it.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The baby is declared itself. Now there's a real question as to like, what does that mean? What are you seeing when something that premature declares itself and here we ran into a real difference. Parents will often see will.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An credible will and resolve.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctors and nurses.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, not so much. That sounds a bit too mystical for me.</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn't take it as there's a voice inside the baby saying I'm going to be a fighter, I'm not one is sick enough not to be able to fight and one isn't.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you see a spirit in a kid?</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think you can see some fight. I call it spunk. A lot of times.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is Tracey Hollis.</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a registered nurse.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was Kelly and Tom's primary nurse.</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At all children's hospital.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And like everyone we spoke to on the hospital side, when it comes to this issue, she chooses her words very carefully.</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I maybe try to keep things a little bit more neutral than talking about their will to live.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because you know a baby at 23 weeks barely has folds on the outside of its brain. It's brain is still smooth for the most part. So who knows what it's capable of thinking or feeling?</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, that's a difficult question. And the truth is things like-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fight spunk may just boil down to physiology.</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe that baby had a few more lung buds to start with.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it had an easier time in Utero, may have nothing to do with will. In fact-</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The baby grasping the finger of a parent, it's actually a reflex that the babies have a grasp reflex. I never tell a parent that because they think it's an intentional movement.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because you know, putting yourself in the parent's head, if you've got to decide how much am I going to push, how much of my heart am I going to pour into this little creature? Maybe if you can see something like will or something like intention. If you see, oh, that's a person in there or maybe if you don't see it, maybe it's the only way you got to make this decision.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. My wife, the professional ethicists often says we don't make important decisions in our life for rational reasons. Very often, no.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keith and his wife, Annie Janvier have done a huge amount of research into the ethics of extremely premature births. But one of the primary reasons we wanted to talk to him is that in addition to being a neonatologist and a guy who publishes a lot of stuff in this area, yeah, he and his recently had a baby girl who was born at 24 weeks and five days.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She weighted 720 grams.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One and a half pounds.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she was actually in my own NICU.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh Wow.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was actually the director of the unit where she was.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he was in his unit into the place where he usually worked. He saw babies make it not make it, and now suddenly he was a parent in that place. And several weeks after his baby was born, there was a very, very big complication.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She actually didn't move at all for about 36 hours. And we thought maybe it was a little-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it's time.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they decided he and his wife to let her go peacefully.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I went back into the NICU you to see her.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And something happened. He looked down and he saw her lips move barely.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She started sucking on a soother that the nurse had put in her mouth.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was sucking on a pacifier and it was just a reflex, the most basic baby reflex, the sucking reflex. He knew that.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just that movement of sucking on a soother-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed his mind completely.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went bank to Annie and said, you can't stop a really need to take continuing and give her the chance.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you knew that the sucking responses is not, that's a fairly deep brain.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. It's a very basic, it's just the brainstem is not know you and you need a lot more than be able to suck to do well. But as I say, I was trying to be the parent there, not the neonatologist.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you remember if the doctor in you was surprised at the father in you?</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I think I was actually a little, yeah. I think if I had to have been more evidence based and rational and scientific, I could have gone either way, but just as a father, I couldn't at that point let it go.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just didn't really know how to process it. I felt like she was, I just had this very acute sense that she had just been like violently ripped out of my body and I could feel where they had cut her out, you know? And like I just wanted to put her back and make her safe, you know?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I had all these questions going through my head, like, you know, like how long does she have to live for us to get a birth certificate for this to be real? I felt like she might die and like it wouldn't count and I wouldn't be a mother, you know what I mean? And I'm like, \"What if she died? What would happen? Like would we have a funeral? They make caskets the size of shoe boxes?\" I mean all of these, like it's so screwed up that that's the stuff you think about.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your brain goes places you just can't control or predict. I wondered like, if she knew, was she really aware that I was even standing there or like was it just a reflex that later grabbed my finger and when she grabbed it, did she know that you know, I was there and if she didn't know I was there, did she wander where I had gone? Did she feel alone? And is she scared?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All she could really do at that point was sit with those questions.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it just became this waiting game.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll continue in a moment.</p>\r\n<p>Steve Chavela:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey guys, this is Steve Chavela calling from Price hill, Ontario, Canada.

Oh the, here's an easy one. Tom, when did you decide to name your daughter [Juniper 00:37:39]</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About five days after she was born.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in those five days, pretty much everything in their lives changed. I mean on the most superficial level, they began their hospital stay days zero in the maternity ward, which had butterflies on the walls and-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Images of roses opening. And everyone's really good looking.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like in an ER sort of way or-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like in a Grey's Anatomy kind of way. We had like one super hot nurse, we called her cupcake and she had this like glossy hair and you know, people would visit me and they'd be like, \"Hey, is cupcake here?\" \"When is cupcake coming by?\" And-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's where their hospital journey began. But five days later, everything had changed and they find themselves on a different floor of the hospital stranded in this unit that is perhaps more than any other place on earth. The physical embodiment of this limbo, the neonatal intensive unit NICU. Where they just have to wait and hope that that will or whatever it was they saw on [Juniper 00:38:43] takes hold.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had been like yanked out of our lives and out of everything that we recognized, yeah, you know, out of our jobs at our house and we just been dropped into this like science fiction, nothing was recognizable. Babies didn't look like babies. There was one baby that had his intestines outside of his body, like piled up on his belly, like in this back and everyone's wearing a uniform, don't know who anyone is. And everything's like beeping and humming.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you don't know how long you're going to be there and you don't have any sense of time. Day and night don't mean anything. And you know, we're sort of dimly aware of the Sun rising and setting out the window. But other than that, it's just like minute to minute, hour to hour. You're afraid to leave even for even for an hour to get some lunch because the baby could die.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, if we went home to get some sleep, would she die.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was that critical.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she had roughly five, six days that went pretty well and then that next weekend.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure blew a hole in her intestines.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the real beginning of a lot of problems and her belly turned dark and got real distended.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were inserting drains-</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the belly to try to drain away-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stool and dunk and she just had this little straw sticking out of her belly.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then they couldn't maintain her blood pressure. So I was thinking of everything I could do because you don't want to feel powerless in a situation like that. You want to feel like there's something you can do.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in quiet moments with Tom would do</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter one, the boy who lived.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he would stand over Juniper's incubator and he would read her Harry Potter.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Gerson of number four private drive. We're proud to say that they were perfectly normal. Thank you very much.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were the last people you would expect to be involved in. Anything strange or mysterious?</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I started reading to her and as the days went on, she has no idea what I'm reading. Right. But there is something there that she responded to. I wanted to say she liked because her, her SAT number would go high at that point. Her sat number.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is that like her oxygen?</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturation of oxygen on her blood.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom says that number on the monitor was one of the only ways that they could get feedback about how she was doing because you know her eyes are still closed. There'd be times when she wasn't moving around a lot. The higher the number the better. And he says when he would read to her, her numbers would go up.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not just slowly but instantly. But then when I got deeper into the story, I read in Haggard's voice \"bout it, professor Dumbledore, Sir\" said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke and she decided instantly.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the alarm just going off and going, okay.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Kelly hit me and she said, \"You're scaring the baby.\" And I'm like, what do you, what you could see even before her eyes opened that she was really responding to what we were doing. She didn't know a chapter is, but she was in her own way, very eagerly waiting for the next chapter. And I don't know, a better way to describe wanting to be alive. Then you want to find out what happens next.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, what happens next is that</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night at around two o'clock in the morning.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a rare night that they actually went to sleep at home, they get a call from their doctor.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His first question was, \"How far do you live from the hospital?\" And you know, that's not a question you want to hear from your child's doctor.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We rushed to the hospital.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when they get there, they were told-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she did it again. She got another hole in her intestines and she started to really spiral.To really go downhill.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her blood pressure and oxygen levels were crashing.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was on 100% oxygen. The ventilator settings were turned up as high as they could go and she was still struggling and faltering and you know, once they are giving your baby 100% oxygen, they can't give her any more.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that point, I had done everything that I could possibly do.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Fauzia Shaquille.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neonatologist at all children's hospital.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was Juniper's doctor at the time. She said she'd given [Juniper 00:43:25] everything she could think of, blood pressure, medicine, antibiotics. She'd put a drain in her abdomen.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But obviously it was not enough.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something was wrong.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terribly wrong.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might lose her at any second. The only option left</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take her to the operating room with car open. clear the intestines, relieve the pressure.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you do a surgery on a one pound baby?

I mean you know she was so extremely premature, so fragile.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So tiny that operating seemed kind of crazy and Doctor Shaquille began to really consider the idea that maybe this was it.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at that point I was at bedside looking at her-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to figure out what to do</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all of a sudden she opened her eyes.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really?</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. She opened her eyes wide and she looked at us. Her eyes were like wide open and she was looking right at the doctor directly staring at her hard. And it was a very powerful moment.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor Shaquille says she decided right then and there we're going into surgery.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think she deserves a chance.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me more about why you made that decision.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, typically babies who are that critical and they're totally unresponsive because they're just fighting for every breath and the ability to just open her eyes at that stage in her life when she had no blood pressure that I could barely record when she had hardly any oxygen for her to just open her eyes and look at us. It was a very powerful statement that I'm still here. I am here, I am still here. Don't give up.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Dr Shaquille Summon, the pediatric surgeon told her they want to move forward with the operation, but the surgeon said?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. The surgeon was adamant that she did not want to do it.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, it's futile and she had blood pressure so unstable that she will not make it out of the OR.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the surgeon told her, even if I can open her up and do the job, her skin is so papery that I might not be able to sew her back.</p>\r\n<p>Nita Farahany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are guidelines that medical industries have even basic things like the hippocratic oath of do no harm.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's law professor and ethicists Nita Farahany again.</p>\r\n<p>Nita Farahany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many physicians legitimately believe that if you have a preterm infants and that infant is in serious peril of spending a life of suffering and pain-</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the only way to do no harm and fulfill your oath is not to do the surgery. She says, if you ask the courts-</p>\r\n<p>Nita Farahany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know right now the law favors life.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The courts have seen very few cases that involve disputes like this, but in every one so far she says they've supported the person who's arguing to keep the child alive.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever there's life, there's hope. So this is our window we should do it now.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Dr Shaquille, the argument that ultimately won the day was simply this.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically what I told her was that if you think she's going to die, she is dying right now as we speak in the unit.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we can either do nothing and she definitely dies or we can do something and she probably dies. But you never know.</p>\r\n<p>Fauzia S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a slim chance.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they're wheeling the incubator with the baby in it and I'm holding her little hand and she's getting ready to go into surgery. And she was looking right at me and she hadn't done that before. I mean, it really seemed like she was aware that I was there very clearly and she was locked on my face, so I only gave her a little kiss on her forehead and Tom did the same thing and then they wheeled her away.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long was the operation?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was... they call, they paged us much more quickly than we expect it to come back. So we knew something was wrong.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nurse assured Tom and Kelly into a separate room.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This little windowless conference room. And the surgeon came in and she said, you know... she was supposed to go in and clean everything out and rinse everything off and find the hole and patch it and, and do all these things. And she said, when she cut the baby open and touched the baby's intestines with her little probe, she's, the way she described it was, everything fell apart. It was just falling apart and falling apart.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you're hearing this.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Juniper 00:48:02] had survived the operation, but barely.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we're thinking like, okay, this was an incredibly risky surgery and we just put her through it for nothing. And I thought there was no way that baby was going live till morning.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd been really working hard to avoid thinking about all the bad things that were possibly going to happen here. Just trying to hold on, you know, and I sort of thought it was my job to do that and I'm just kind of funny, kind of stereotypically male with me.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Tom says they were in the car around the time of the surgery.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we're driving, you know, by that time [Juniper 00:48:46] and I were about two thirds of the way through the first book and this thought just snuck in on me, which was, what if I don't get to finish reading this book? What if she doesn't get to hear the ending? And you know, she never finds out. You know, what happens to Hereon, Hermione and Ron.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thought led in all the other thoughts, very difficult thoughts about all the things we wouldn't get to do with her. She would never get to know. And I had this terrible thought that, you know, she was in this incubator, this isolated this plastic box. And I had this terrible thought that she was just going to go from one box to another. And I had to pull over, you know, cause I just lost it.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at that point that wasn't maintaining anymore. There was no holding back. This flood of what was happening. And we had a rule at Kelly and I, which was that only one of us got to lose it at a time. And you know, that was my turn to lose it.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're in a very unnatural situation of neonatal intensive care, which is so recent in the developed world and still doesn't exist in much of the world. And working so hard to save babies is very new.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neonatologist, Keith Barrington.</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In evolutionary history, newborn babies very frequently died. And most parents who have, any significant number of children had lost one or two or three or more. And in order to be able to carry on with your life and to provide for the rest of your family, we had to be able to attempt to the deaths of babies. And now that has become much less common to lose a baby. Even no miscarriages and stillbirths are now we realizing how much that hurts. And in the past, maybe we've hidden some of that from ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No way the baby was going to live til morning. But what happened was really strange. She continued to just not die. And the next day she, you know, she was still there. The surgeon was surprised and-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one can quite explain it.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more I thought about it, the more I found it like surprising and interesting, you know, because she doesn't know that there's a better place, you know, but she's just in this box and she's gotten needles coming out of every which way and tube down her throat. She has no idea that one day, you know, she'll just be held and rocked and then we'll take her out for ice cream and she'll play with the dog. And, and I just wonder like what is she fighting for? So that became, you know, our job, the best that we can articulate it was to try to give her some sense of something beyond that place.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the surgery, things did not get easier.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would stop breathing many times a day. Teams would rush into anything.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on [Juniper 00:52:28] but come back, come back. I remember the room spinning and then she started to swell for like weeks and weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she continued-</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To not die</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she began to gain weight.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you know, nurses are very superstitious. A lot of them, they won't say the word at home.</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason. When the baby's here, that word-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Tracy Hollis again, primary nurse.</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They get sick and we just, it's a superstition obviously, but something happens and sometimes it can be devastating.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what do you say instead?</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll say that place that the baby's going to go when they leave here.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, I got so tortured.</p>\r\n<p>Tracey Hollis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes we spell it, which makes no sense at all.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But after about four and a half months, Diane, that nurse Practitioner told us that we might want to think about buying a car seat. That was the first inclination that we might able to take her out of there.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the first time I've ever imagined a choir of angels singing around mentioned of car seat.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Car seats. Right? But when you're, what do you want to have a baby really bad and everybody else has a baby but you and you can't have a baby. Things like shopping for car seats become like fantasies, you know, like, and finally, you know, the doctor gave the all clear and we took the monitors off of her and she was completely free and untethered, not hooked to anything. And we strapped her in his car seat and I put a little pair of sunglasses on her, cause I didn't know if her eyes would be okay in the sunlight. She'd never seen the sun.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we all kind of walked out and Tracy is really not a hugger, but we like grabbed her and hugged her and cried and all over her shirt and then we put the baby in the car and we went to [inaudible 00:54:21]. That was totally before the gay thing. Before I stopped going to [inaudible 00:54:28] and.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all in all. How long were you in the hospital for?</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six and a half months. I was just 196 days. How has Juniper now? What is? Can you give us a snapshot of her morning?</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually Tom and Kelly were nice enough to allow us to send a reporter to their house to meet her.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's two years old now.</p>\r\n<p>Jennifer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's [Juniper 00:55:01] good morning [Juniper 00:55:06] hi</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's Jennifer. Say Hi.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we got there, she was still, she was just waking up.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She not [inaudible 00:55:17] this morning .</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then she just sprung up, jumped out of bed and took off.</p>\r\n<p>Juniper:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [inaudible 00:55:32]</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, he went to Daddy. Isn't that funny?</p>\r\n<p>Juniper:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [inaudible 00:55:45] [inaudible 00:55:45]</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on, show me where the kitty is. I know you want to give the kitty a hug. She's nice.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's kind of your typical two year old.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And because we were there, Juniper felt it was kind of important that we see some tricks she's learned. This is radio, so they have no idea what you just did.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somersaults. You know, it's interesting because, as journalists again, we spend a lot of time chronicling sometimes very terrible things. And what's interesting is that during the chair yesterday morning, by journalistic standards, nothing happened.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, what we need to do is change your diaper.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wouldn't even be on journalistic radar. But what, you know, as a parent comes in, especially after you've been through what we went through,</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you come to Mommy, I'm want to kiss you.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was everything.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to kiss you and nothing you can do about it either. We ready.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything happened yesterday in those couple of hours. The entire world was contained inside that morning.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. Can I have some more kisses?</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all of the blank chapters of her life were inside that morning waiting to be written.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which one you want this book come here.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do you feel like you're out of the woods? both Tom and Kelly said no way. And then Tom tell us about these flu shots that [Juniper 00:57:56] gets.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They're not just flu shots. They're like flu shots like super flu shots and they, there's four shots you get and I swear to God that cost $14,000 for those four shots.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is, that's a real number you just said?</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a fact. They are designed to help protect her from a RSV, which is a virus that in most people just presents as a common cold. But you know, she, her lungs are still recovering and are still developing and RSV can be devastating and there are some other concerns that could still creep in down the road. Some studies have shown that kids who are born prematurely struggle more in school with reading and math.</p>\r\n<p>Tom French:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's often, they're more susceptible to depression and anxiety.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Benham:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I will say that, we took her to visit a preschool the other day and we took her there and sat her down and she just took off and like went up to the easy giant children and started taking their toys and they were singing the wheels on the bus and you could see it in her eyes. I know that song and she didn't care about Tom or I one bit, you know, she was totally there with those kids and she was so ready and I thought, wow. Like she might be okay. She is okay.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case you're wondering Keith Barrington the neonatologist we spoke to earlier when we asked him how his daughter's doing. Out of curiosity, how is, how is a viola doing now?</p>\r\n<p>Keith B:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is great. She's coming to the end of the fifth grade in school and she's perfect.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we should say these are two stories of babies who made it, but in this brand new frontier of course their main stories of babies who don't.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A big thank you to all children's Hospital and St.Petersburg, Florida for letting us talk to pretty much everybody and-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And record the sounds of their queue.

You're ... listening ... to ... to Radiolab. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 4:</span> <span>00:58</span> <span>I just thought I'd see if I could get the sound of babies sleeping. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>01:09</span> <span>This is Radiolab. Today's program is about sleep. I don't have to tell you how good sleep is. You do it yourself every night. Well, you try. And how wonderful when it actually works, when you can close your eyes and forget the day and just drift off into oblivion like a little baby. But let's suppose that you are a little baby, this little baby, and you grew up to become a scientist, like one of the scientists we'll hear from in this program, and you decide to ask what should be the dumbest question ever. Why do we sleep? And not just us. Well, pretty much everything sleeps. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 6:</span> <span>01:53</span> <span>As far as we know, all mammals do it. All birds.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 7:</span> <span>01:56</span> <span>Bees, locusts, cockroaches, crayfish ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 6:</span> <span>01:59</span> <span>Reptiles, insects. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 7:</span> <span>02:00</span> <span>Scorpions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>02:01</span> <span>Anything that's been studied has something that looks like sleep. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>02:04</span> <span>It's a mystery. Most things we sort of know what they are for, and also how they work. But sleep is really in your face. I mean, everybody does it. You do it from the cradle to the grave. You can't help doing it, because if you try to stay awake, at some point it's irrepressible. And we don't know why. That's a shameful state of affairs. How can you be a scientist in the 21st century and not know the answer to that? There you go. Okay. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>02:37</span> <span>Yeah, nice word, shame. Okay. [inaudible 00:02:37]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>02:37</span> <span>That's a pretty good way to begin. You know?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>02:39</span> <span>With shame? </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>02:40</span> <span>Yeah, yeah. Today on Radiolab, we're gonna try to correct this shameful state of affairs when it comes to the subject of sleep. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>02:46</span> <span>We'll talk with people who can help us understand what it's for ... </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>02:49</span> <span>Why we do it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>02:50</span> <span>... and what happens when we don't. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>02:53</span> <span>I'm Robert Krulwich. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>02:54</span> <span>I'm Jad Abumrad. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>02:55</span> <span>Stay with us. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>03:05</span> <span>For centuries, people thought that sleep was kind of the opposite of being awake. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>03:10</span> <span>It's reasonable, one would think.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>03:12</span> <span>Sure, because during the day, you're doing all these things, you're having all these thoughts and feelings. At night, you just lie there very, very still. In fact, like sometimes a bomb could go off and you wouldn't wake up. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>03:23</span> <span>I can hardly wake up even in a fire. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>03:26</span> <span>I don't know why ... </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>03:30</span> <span>No, I'm a really heavy sleepy. I'm a very, very heavy sleeper. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>03:33</span> <span>The point is, if all you've got are your eyes to go on, sleep can seem like being ... Well- </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>03:39</span> <span>Like being off. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>03:40</span> <span>Yeah, like off-ness. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>03:42</span> <span>Right. Or worse. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>03:44</span> <span>Well, both Shakespeare and Cervantes referred to sleep as death.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>03:49</span> <span>That's Dr. Carlos Shank. He wrote a great book about sleep called Paradox Lost.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>03:53</span> <span>We go to bed every night, we die every night, and then we wake up in the morning and we're alive again and that was the prevailing theory for centuries. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>04:01</span> <span>For Dr. Shank, the awakening to just how wrong Shakespeare and Cervantes were about sleep came one day while he was sitting in class for med school. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>04:09</span> <span>My first year at medical school ... </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>04:11</span> <span>This was back in 1972. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>04:12</span> <span>... we have an emeritus professor who actually was a Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Eccles, Sir John Carew Eccles from Australia and ... </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>04:20</span> <span>Here's what happened. This esteemed lecturer walks into class, pops a cassette into the tape deck, hits play, and out comes this sound. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>04:27</span> <span>Well, the sound was ... or ... wait a second, let me get it right. Oh, here we go ... and multiply this by a hundred ... </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>04:45</span> <span>This, the professor announced is the sound of a cat's brain while asleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>04:51</span> <span>My God.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>04:53</span> <span>Shank almost fell out of his seat.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>04:55</span> <span>This is the brain during sleep? Making these really rapid, high=pitched, multiple sounds. That just blew us away. It was just ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>05:03</span> <span>Clearly, while that cat was curled up in it's little kitty basket, its brain was very, very alive, much more than anyone expected. And this is still a weird revelation. Like, take my cat, Sammy. All right. That's just the sound of my cat, Sammy sleeping. To think that while Sammy is sitting on my lap, totally out, there's a circus happening in his brain. What's going on in there? If you can imagine, back in the '70s, this was a paradime shift. People were suddenly like, \"oh my God, if we're gonna figure out anything about sleep, we have to ask the brain\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>05:42</span> <span>And then this is the room where we do all of our surgeries.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>05:45</span> <span>And luckily, that's easily done, if you're willing to get your hands dirty.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>05:51</span> <span>Okay, so the first step is you have to make an incision on top of the animal's head. When you've done that, we drill holes through the animal's skull ... and then you insert your electrodes ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>06:05</span> <span>Then you've got a little window into their brain. You could see right there on the screen, you could see the brain waves ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>06:12</span> <span>Now, are you out of your mind? Did you just put a hole into a kitten's head?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>06:15</span> <span>No, that wasn't my cat. C'mon.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>06:17</span> <span>So what was it we were doing there?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>06:18</span> <span>What you just heard was a mock surgery to an iguana, actually. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>06:22</span> <span>Even an iguana, man. It's not a nice thing to do.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>06:27</span> <span>Within 20 minutes of coming out of the anesthetic, the animal is moving around, it's eating, it's climbing and it's basking. It might seem like a rather invasive procedure, but in actuality, it's not too bad at all.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>06:37</span> <span>Uh-huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>06:38</span> <span>Yeah. And that, by the way, is John Lescue. He's a graduate student at the Ecology Department-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>06:42</span> <span>At Indiana State University.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>06:44</span> <span>Which is where we are. John gave our reporter, Carol Oller-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Carol Oller:</span> <span>06:47</span> <span>Testing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>06:49</span> <span>-a tour of the lab.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>06:50</span> <span>There are big boys here and they all have nice hats.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>06:52</span> <span>Showed her the iguanas.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Carol Oller:</span> <span>06:54</span> <span>These guys are a little frightening to me. They're pretty huge.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>06:57</span> <span>They're like four feet long, head to tail.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>07:00</span> <span>Oh, I didn't know that.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>07:00</span> <span>I mean, they look like baby alligators.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>07:02</span> <span>Pick that one up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>07:02</span> <span>And John measures their brain waves at night to see what happens in their head as they sleep. In a way, it's a continuation of that cat experiment that Dr. Shank just told us about. Except, what they're looking for is much more peculiar than could ever happen in a cat or in us.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>07:17</span> <span>What is that?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>07:20</span> <span>Let me put it to you as a puzzle, okay?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>07:20</span> <span>Mm-hmm (affirmative)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>07:21</span> <span>Forget iguanas. Dolphins. Right? Dolphins.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>07:24</span> <span>Yup.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>07:25</span> <span>How is it that a dolphin, in the ocean, or even say the dolphins that you might find at Six Flags in New Jersey, I think they have two.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Megan Tuterra:</span> <span>07:34</span> <span>Cody is our 10 year old, Atlantic Bottlenose dolphin. His buddy, Avalon, is 12 years old ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>07:40</span> <span>And that's their trainer, Megan Tuterra. Avera Metra is holding the mic. Anyhow, here's the puzzle and we asked Megan about this. How is that her two dolphins, Cody and Avalon, can successfully sleep given the inherent challenges of being a dolphin?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>07:40</span> <span>I don't know. What are the challenges of a dolphin?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>07:58</span> <span>Well, they have significant challenges, my friend. First, they've gotta breathe.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Megan Tuterra:</span> <span>08:02</span> <span>They're conscious breathers. They're not unconscious breathers. So they have to think about breathing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>08:07</span> <span>Making matters worse, dolphins are not fish, so they have to breathe air, which means they have to constantly, consciously, come up to the service to breathe air every few minutes. So you can imagine what would happen if they decided to unconscious for a wile.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>08:22</span> <span>They would drown.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>08:23</span> <span>Right. And yet they do manage to sleep. A lot.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>08:27</span> <span>How long?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>08:29</span> <span>Eight hours a day. Like us.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>08:30</span> <span>Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>08:31</span> <span>Yeah, eight hours.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>08:32</span> <span>But how?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>08:33</span> <span>That's the puzzle.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Megan Tuterra:</span> <span>08:33</span> <span>What happens is they do what we call logging.it's when they rest on the surface of the water. You know when a log floats down a river, it just floats? That's exactly what they look like. And they rest half their brain at a time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>08:47</span> <span>Half their brain is asleep?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Megan Tuterra:</span> <span>08:49</span> <span>Half their brain is asleep at a time. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>08:51</span> <span>That is nature's solution. To cut the dolphin brain in half.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>08:55</span> <span>You mean literally in half?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>08:56</span> <span>Literally in half. So that one half can snooze while the other half keeps the dolphin swimming and surfacing-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>09:02</span> <span>Wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>09:02</span> <span>-just enough to breathe. From the outside, you can't really tell what's happening. It just looks like the dolphin is sort of awake, but a little out of it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Megan Tuterra:</span> <span>09:09</span> <span>Well it's almost like the state of when you're falling asleep, but if something happened, you'd wake right up. So they're in that state all the time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Steve Lema:</span> <span>09:17</span> <span>This little guy can be characterized as groggy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>09:19</span> <span>That's Steve Lema. He runs one of the labs back in Indiana. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Steve Lema:</span> <span>09:22</span> <span>They're sort of awake and they're sort of asleep then. It's just a way of staying awake enough.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>09:27</span> <span>And again, it's easy to miss, but if you look inside that groggy dolphin's brain at what the brainwaves are doing ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Steve Lema:</span> <span>09:33</span> <span>It's exquisitely obvious ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>09:35</span> <span>It's clear as day.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Steve Lema:</span> <span>09:36</span> <span>A six year old could figure it out. When half the brain has these beautiful slow waves like a sign curve and the other one's just jagging all over the place.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 15:</span> <span>09:53</span> <span>Awesome.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 16:</span> <span>09:53</span> <span>Wow, those are beautiful.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>09:54</span> <span>Wow, that is amazing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>09:56</span> <span>Yeah, it's called unihemispheric sleep. That's what the guys at Indiana State are really interested in because ... and here's the next surprise, it seems to go way beyond dolphins.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>10:06</span> <span>Oh yeah. They're aquatic mammals like whales, seals and sea lions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>10:10</span> <span>John says that all of the marine mammals that have been studied seem to do it too.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>10:13</span> <span>Recently, walruses, they're all are found to engage in unihemispheric sleep as well.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>10:18</span> <span>And now the Indiana team led by ... by this guy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>10:22</span> <span>I'm Charles Amlanner, Chair of the Department of Ecology and Organismal Biology.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>10:27</span> <span>They have found this weird split-brain behavior in creatures of the air.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>10:31</span> <span>Oh?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>10:31</span> <span>Okay, let me just back up a little bit and describe this experiment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>10:37</span> <span>Charlie and his student had been at the park one day and they noticed something.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>10:39</span> <span>We observed that ducks ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>10:41</span> <span>Ducks.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>10:43</span> <span>... sometimes will get together into groups.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>10:45</span> <span>Like, on a log. Four ducks will get together and snooze in a neat little line.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>10:49</span> <span>And the birds that were sitting in the middle of that line tended to be sleeping with both eyes closed. The birds that were sitting on the outside of that row tended to look a little bit more wary. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>11:04</span> <span>The inevitable question ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>11:05</span> <span>What's going on here?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>11:07</span> <span>... led to a very simple experiment. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>11:08</span> <span>We put four birds in a row.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>11:09</span> <span>Four mallard ducks, this time in the lab and they watched them sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>11:13</span> <span>The two birds in the center of this row slept with both eyes closed. The birds on the outer edges, both left and right, slept with one eye closed and one eye opened.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>11:24</span> <span>One more time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>11:25</span> <span>Slept with one eye closed and one eye opened. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>11:28</span> <span>It's just like in that song. Do you know that Metallica song?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>11:36</span> <span>I missed it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>11:36</span> <span>It's a good one.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>11:38</span> <span>But I knew they were all botanists. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>11:39</span> <span>It's true. You know, no one knows this, but that song is really about adaptive sleeping behavior in ducks.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>11:48</span> <span>The outer eye, the eye that was faced away from the group, the eye that was facing towards where potential predators might come from, that stayed open.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>11:57</span> <span>At this point, Charlie had a pretty good idea of what was going on, because he knew that inside bird brains, each eye is attached to the opposite hemisphere.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>12:06</span> <span>The left eye is attached to the right hemisphere, the right eye is attached to the left hemisphere.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>12:12</span> <span>So his team implanted some electrodes to measure what the duck brains were doing and, voila! Like the dolphins, the ducks too were sleeping one half of their brain at a time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>12:24</span> <span>The bird could simultaneously sleep and be awake.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>12:29</span> <span>Not only that, here's the cool part, after a few hours ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>12:31</span> <span>What happened was is that the birds that were on the outer edge, then would rotate-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>12:36</span> <span>Stand up, turn around.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>12:37</span> <span>-180 degrees.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>12:38</span> <span>And then sit back down.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>12:40</span> <span>And the other eye would then get some sleep and consequently the opposite hemisphere would get some sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 18:</span> <span>12:45</span> <span>When we saw that we said \"oh yeah, that's good.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>12:50</span> <span>Good, because right there, in the ducks, was a perfect illustration of what these guys think it's all about. You gotta sleep, for whatever reason.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>12:58</span> <span>Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>12:58</span> <span>But sleep is dangerous. That's the headline. For dolphins, the main danger is drowning. You know? For ducks ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>13:08</span> <span>Getting eaten.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>13:08</span> <span>Exactly. Ducks have to sleep, but how can they when lurking in the darkness are foxes, wolves and a hundred other eaters of ducks.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 19:</span> <span>13:19</span> <span>Hey you guys.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>13:19</span> <span>Do you like snakes?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 19:</span> <span>13:20</span> <span>I don't know. Not really.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>13:24</span> <span>What?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 19:</span> <span>13:24</span> <span>I mean, I don't dislike snakes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>13:26</span> <span>He's a good man, he's a good man.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>13:28</span> <span>In another nifty experiment, John took the resident snake, Monty ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>13:32</span> <span>This is Monty.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 19:</span> <span>13:35</span> <span>Hi.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>13:35</span> <span>Big snake.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>13:36</span> <span>He is, what, about a four foot long python.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>13:40</span> <span>And at night ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>13:40</span> <span>You're so cute.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>13:41</span> <span>... John brought Monty, the python into the room where his iguanas sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>13:45</span> <span>And he terrifies them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>13:45</span> <span>Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>13:47</span> <span>Well, I mean, Monty was in a cage so he couldn't really hurt the iguanas, but as soon as that snake appeared, all the lizards popped one eye open.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>13:54</span> <span>I bet they did.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>13:56</span> <span>Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. And they trained that open eye right on Monty the snake.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Steve Lema:</span> <span>13:59</span> <span>Put a big snake in the room and they'll watch it with one eye all night.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>14:03</span> <span>That's Steve Lema again.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Steve Lema:</span> <span>14:04</span> <span>They don't like these snakes, that's for sure. And we moved the snake from the room the next day and they're still looking for it the next night or two.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>14:10</span> <span>So they keep one eye trained on that door for a few more days?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Steve Lema:</span> <span>14:13</span> <span>About two or three days, then they go back to regular sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>14:29</span> <span>So what does this all mean? Well, think about this. Okay, all the sea mammals, they do it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>14:33</span> <span>Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>14:34</span> <span>At least the ones that have been studied. All the flying creatures, they do it. The reptiles seem to do it too. Who does that leave?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>14:42</span> <span>You mean who's left not sleeping with half a brain on and the other half a brain off?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>14:45</span> <span>Yeah. Us!</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>14:50</span> <span>Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>14:51</span> <span>We may be the strange ones.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>14:53</span> <span>Well it is sort of strange in that terrestrial mammals can't do it. Terrestrial mammals just for some reason have lost the ability to do this.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>14:59</span> <span>Not all mammals, says John, the terrestrial mammals. The ones that live on land. And here's his theory. Sometime, long ago, our scaly ancestor wandered up on the land and thought, \"I think I'll dig a hole. Yeah, I'm gonna dig a hole.\" And the hole was dark and it was safe and for the first time in millions of years of evolution, that little creature closed both eyes. And so we lost it. Totally speculative theory of course, but the basic idea, though, is if you are protected and safe, you can afford to close both eyes. Conk out completely. And that simple idea of safety, that explains ... well these guys think, almost everything. Where you sleep, how you sleep, how long you sleep, it all boils down to two words. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Steve Lema:</span> <span>15:55</span> <span>Predation risk.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>15:56</span> <span>Predation risk.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>15:57</span> <span>Predation risk.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>15:58</span> <span>Which is really just fancy way of saying ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Charles Amlanne:</span> <span>16:00</span> <span>Generally speaking, just your risk of being killed.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>16:02</span> <span>Your risk of being eaten. Now, what does this have to do with us? Here we are, top of the food chain, in our warm beds.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>16:13</span> <span>Nice warm bed.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>16:14</span> <span>A locked door.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>16:15</span> <span>A locked door. Covers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>16:17</span> <span>Maybe a nice neighborhood.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>16:18</span> <span>A good police force looking after you at nighttime and you live in a country that has a very secure living environment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>16:27</span> <span>You would think that this whole predation risk idea has nothing to do with us. Well?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>16:33</span> <span>Well, there's a few studies that have looked at say sleep patterns where people are sleeping in novel environments.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>16:40</span> <span>What's a novel environment? What does he mean?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>16:41</span> <span>Well, like a hotel.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>16:43</span> <span>Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>16:43</span> <span>That first night at hotel, why is it no one can sleep well that first night at a hotel?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>16:47</span> <span>On your first night of sleeping in a hotel room, you generally have less REM sleep and less deep slow wave sleep relative to sleeping in your house.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>16:57</span> <span>I suffer from that myself, I don't sleep we hotel rooms. Especially if it was just one night per place or something, my sleep is terrible.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>John Lescue:</span> <span>17:04</span> <span>There are some folk that actually hypothesize there are certain predator relays in the brain and that these circuits remain active at all times. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>17:20</span> <span>Now what if that's true that we all have buried deep in our reptile brain a sort of predator alert system? Perhaps in some of us, it's a little too sensitive.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>17:33</span> <span>Okay we're in the sleep lab at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorder Center, Mission Control, we call it. We're viewing the typical sleep terror episode. This little girl who is five years old would engage in these sleep terror episodes every single night.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>17:49</span> <span>That's Dr. Carlos Shank, who we heard from before. We're in Minnesota now at the Hennipin County Sleep Center, where he works.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>17:49</span> <span>Here in the sleep lab-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>17:56</span> <span>We're standing in front of a grainy, black and white video of a little girl in her pj's, screaming. Dr. Shank discovered an odd category of sleep disorders called parasomnias, which is why we came to talk to him. Para means around, somnia means sleep. Around sleep. This might be the human analog to the ducks. People who's brains never quite shut off completely during sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>18:20</span> <span>Well this guy is interesting. He has seizures. No, no, no, he doesn't. Wait a second.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>18:25</span> <span>He showed us tape after tape.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>18:26</span> <span>We're viewing a man who we very affectionately call Santa Claus. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>18:30</span> <span>On the screen, a large guy thrashes back and forth.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>18:34</span> <span>His legs are moving, he's going back and forth from his side to his back.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>18:38</span> <span>And then, suddenly he starts to ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 20:</span> <span>18:39</span> <span>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>18:39</span> <span>Is this real?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>18:53</span> <span>Yeah, this guy is in and out of sleep. He has no idea what he's doing. One of the interesting things Dr. Shank noticed when he first began to diagnose parasomnias in the early '80s is that while they were in that kind of liminal space around sleep, a huge percentage of the patients would have these visceral dreams of being attacked.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>19:10</span> <span>The common theme is a menace is posed from nowhere, coming out of nowhere. It's an immediate threat that you just can't ignore. Let's put it that way. You have to either fight it or run away from it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Martin Sabelle:</span> <span>19:21</span> <span>The dreams can be very violent.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>19:25</span> <span>This is Martin Sabelle, age 88. He's another of Dr. Shanks' patients. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Martin Sabelle:</span> <span>19:29</span> <span>I remember someone coming up the stairway.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>19:33</span> <span>In Martin's case, the attackers never had a face. Sometimes it was a bear.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Martin Sabelle:</span> <span>19:37</span> <span>And I was gonna fight with him.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Gertrude Sabell:</span> <span>19:40</span> <span>He'd yell at them, \"Get out of here.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>19:42</span> <span>That's Martin's wife, Gertrude.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Gertrude Sabell:</span> <span>19:44</span> <span>\"Scram!\" It was always trying to protect me.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Martin Sabelle:</span> <span>19:47</span> <span>Yeah, I would have black and blue bruises on my arms and hands because I was hitting the headboard.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Carlos Shan:</span> <span>19:54</span> <span>Not infrequently, the man is dreaming, in be with his wife, that he is fighting to defend her from an attacker, when in fact, he's beating her up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Gertrude Sabell:</span> <span>20:01</span> <span>One night I was sleeping and all of a sudden he's got his hands tightly around my throat. I'm petrified. \"Quit Mart, you're dreaming. You're hurting me.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Martin Sabelle:</span> <span>20:12</span> <span>She says, \"Martin, you're dreaming.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>20:14</span> <span>Gertrude and Martin Sabelle are still married, believe it or not, after 57 years. Though she did force him to sell his guns.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Gertrude Sabell:</span> <span>20:22</span> <span>He has never been happy about that.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Martin Sabelle:</span> <span>20:24</span> <span>Well, they were quite valuable.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>20:26</span> <span>So you're suggesting, then, that all these people and the iguanas and the ducks and the dolphins all have a portion of their brain which is weary in the night?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>20:37</span> <span>That's what I'm hinting at. I don't wanna go any stronger than hint at, but there seems to be something in us that's always watching out, always wary.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>20:47</span> <span>Bottom line here though is that sleep for all creatures is a dangerous thing and a few unfortunate people are still awake to that fact.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>20:56</span> <span>That's right. Before we go to break, I just wanna thank Ann Hepperman for excellent reporting in Minnesota and also before her, Cara [Oller 00:21:03]. And to remind you to stay with us because we're gonna turn our attention shortly from danger to deprivation.

And you're-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>22:57</span> <span>I'm Jad Abumrad. And today our topic on Radiolab is sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>23:00</span> <span>Yup. It is something that all of us do, we can't help but do it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>23:04</span> <span>It's so good.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>23:04</span> <span>It's dangerous to do. It's so good. And it's universal. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Steve Lema:</span> <span>23:07</span> <span>Think about it, sleep is dangerous. And if sleep could have been circumvented in some way, natural selection probably would have found a way to do it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>23:14</span> <span>That's Steve Lema again from Indiana State University.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Steve Lema:</span> <span>23:18</span> <span>Because it would just be such a great idea to not sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>23:21</span> <span>Don't I know it. But there are times when you just can't sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>23:25</span> <span>Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>23:25</span> <span>Maybe you're one of the 35 million Americans, I am, who has chronic insomnia. You just can't sleep. You don't know why. It just doesn't happen. Or maybe you do it to yourself. You pull all nighters for school or you have to drive long distances or ... and here's what we wanna turn our attention to next, maybe it is done to you. That's the case with producer, Hannah Palin. She kept this audio diary of her own experiment with sleep deprivation. She has an 18 month old son.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Hannah Palin:</span> <span>23:59</span> <span>It's 2:54, for the record. Today was my first day back at work. We were discussing budgets. I just ... I couldn't even articulate what it was that I was seeing on my computer screen and try to communicate that to the curator that I work for. The words didn't come. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Lie down. Lie down on me.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Instead of saying, \"well, Nicolette, I believe that that choice was made because ... \" no, no, all that came out was, \"honey buckets\" I mean nothing, nothing would come out. There was just no brain cells, really. So anyway, that was my first day back at work. 2:47. Dominic will not sleep. I don't know why. I'm trying to get him to sleep and I'm kind of at my wit's end. God, this just sucks. Totally sucks. Here's the funny thing. Everybody has a theory. When I was talking to my sister-in-law tonight and her theory is that he's not enough milk because milk has some agent in it that would help him sleep. And he doesn't like milk. It's true. Other people say, \"oh if you just would exercise him. If he just gets fresh air and exercise, he'll sleep all night. If you just let him cry, he would sleep all night. If you just would do whatever it is we're not doing, he would sleep all night.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span>And this is feeling like I am doing it all wrong and that I'm a failure as a parent. I don't know how to do this.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>C'mere Sweetie. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Just lay down on me.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>So anyway, I needed to record just one thing really quickly and that is that yesterday and today I've been struck by these waves of satisfaction and delight with being alive and this amazing landscape with a funny kid. And these beautiful mountains and water and I don't know, maybe it's just getting a little more sleep in the last couple of days. But I suddenly feel like, wow. I'm so lucky. Okay, I've gotta take my kid to play now. Here we go. Do you know the muffin man? The muffin man ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Okay, that whole I'm loving life, yeah, that's all gone now. And it's pretty much because Dominic won't take a nap. We came home from the beach, which I thought would wear him out. Then we sat down and read some stories, which for some reason ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And I realize that an element to the sleep depravation and an element to this whole thing is that I get angry from having my own needs subverted to the needs of this little tiny person. Which, when you're not sleep deprived is not a big deal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dominic:</span> <span>28:01</span> <span>I'm tired.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Hannah Palin:</span> <span>28:02</span> <span>I'm tired.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dominic:</span> <span>28:04</span> <span>I'm tired. I sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Hannah Palin:</span> <span>28:09</span> <span>I don't wanna wish a minute of Dominic's childhood away because it's so precious to me. But damn, I am looking forward to that moment when I'm able to say, \"honey, time to go to sleep\" and he does it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Are you tired?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dominic:</span> <span>28:09</span> <span>No.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Hannah Palin:</span> <span>28:31</span> <span>You're not tired? Close your eyes, Bug. Close your eyes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>There's my personal take on what it's like to be sleepy and to crave sleep as much as you crave water or breath. I crave it thanks to [inaudible 00:28:57]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>28:57</span> <span>And her son, Dominic and her husband Steve. I know, poor Hannah. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>29:03</span> <span>But there is a science question lurking in the background, which is when Hannah was so tired, why does she feel that way? </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>29:14</span> <span>Because she hasn't been sleeping.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>29:17</span> <span>Well, yeah. But what is the essence of tiredness?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>29:22</span> <span>Lack of sleep. Hello?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>29:24</span> <span>Chemically, I'm asking. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>29:25</span> <span>Oh, got it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>29:27</span> <span>What is happening to her? If you were way down in her cells, could you see something tired-like going on? That's what I wanna know.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>29:33</span> <span>That's a good question, actually.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>29:34</span> <span>Good. I'm glad you think so because I know a guy who has a theory about this.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Alan Pack:</span> <span>29:38</span> <span>Did you see Tiger yesterday, huh? Tiger Woods is just, he's unbelievable. He's the best of anybody. I mean the guy is unbelievable.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>29:45</span> <span>This is Dr. Alan Pack and in addition to being a rabid golf fan, he's also a rabid ... can you be a rabid biologist?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>29:52</span> <span>Sure.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>29:52</span> <span>At the University of Pennsylvania. He's been looking at sleep down at the cellular level. And one thing that he's found over and over and over ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Alan Pack:</span> <span>30:00</span> <span>And that's been showing in mouse, it's been showing in rat, it's been showing in fruit fly.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>30:04</span> <span>... is that inside certain cells, in all those different animals, when they're sleep deprived ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Alan Pack:</span> <span>30:08</span> <span>Eventually what happens is you don't get proteins properly folded.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>30:14</span> <span>Excuse me? Proteins properly folded?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>30:17</span> <span>A phenomenon called the unfolded protein response.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>30:20</span> <span>What on earth does that mean? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>30:23</span> <span>Are you asking why do you need proteins to properly fold?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>30:25</span> <span>Yeah, I guess that's what I'm asking.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>30:26</span> <span>Well, you're made from proteins. Proteins are the essence of you. So if your proteins are misshapen, if they're not folded properly ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Alan Pack:</span> <span>30:35</span> <span>If you don't fold the proteins properly, then don't have the right three dimensional structure and as a result they start accumulating I the cell and then these different unfolded proteins can aggregata together and form clumps. Clumps. Clumps. In say, the cell and essentially clog up and it's really quite toxic to cells.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>30:58</span> <span>Clumpiness equals tiredness is what his formula ... remember when Hannah was so exhausted?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>31:04</span> <span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Hannah Palin:</span> <span>31:05</span> <span>God, this just sucks.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>31:06</span> <span>Well, because she hasn't slept much ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Hannah Palin:</span> <span>31:08</span> <span>Totally sucks.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>31:09</span> <span>Inside her cells, lots of these valuable little proteins have not folded properly. That, he thinks, is the consequence of not having enough sleep. So maybe what's going on is the cells can't do their business quite as well and things start to break down and that adds up across the whole of your body to a feeling of ... but when she gets the sleep ... remember when she's so happy?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>31:31</span> <span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Hannah Palin:</span> <span>31:31</span> <span>I suddenly feel like, wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>31:33</span> <span>Because of the sleep ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Hannah Palin:</span> <span>31:34</span> <span>I'm so lucky.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>31:35</span> <span>... a group of cleaner uppers have gone through her cells, removed the toxic and misshapen proteins so that ... and in fact sleep is the best housemaid you've ever had in the hotel of you. And this idea, the idea of sleep as a cleaner upper might even explain one of the most basic things about us as humans, how we learn. That's the notion of Dr. Julio [Tenonie 00:32:02].</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Ellen Horn:</span> <span>32:02</span> <span>Testing, testing. Testing, testing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>32:05</span> <span>And my producer, Ellen Horn and I went to visit him at his offices in Madison Wisconsin. What are we expecting? What does he look like? We don't know what he looks like.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Ellen Horn:</span> <span>32:05</span> <span>A football player.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>32:14</span> <span>A football player?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Ellen Horn:</span> <span>32:17</span> <span>But like a quarterback or tightend, not like a linebacker.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>32:19</span> <span>Not like a linebacker. So big, but not overwhelming?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Ellen Horn:</span> <span>32:26</span> <span>Yes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>32:28</span> <span>How do you even know that?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Ellen Horn:</span> <span>32:30</span> <span>Website. See, but I was totally wrong.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>32:34</span> <span>Now to be fair, he is a very attractive guy. He has sandy blonde hair and glasses. He's actually more the sensitive guy intellectual than a linebacker. Introduce yourself.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>32:43</span> <span>I'm Julio Tenonie, I am a professor of psychiatry here at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>32:48</span> <span>But when it comes to the subject of sleep, which is his specialty, he takes sleep very seriously. What go you into sleep?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>32:56</span> <span>Sleep is the annihilation of conscious. So it's a terrible time in which everything disappears. The universe and yourself with it. I think if people didn't sleep and didn't have the unconsciousness of sleep, they possibly wouldn't even realize that consciousness is an enormous gift.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>33:12</span> <span>So being awake then, is wonderful. But it's what happens when you're asleep, he says, that's what allows you to make very important connections in your life. And he noticed this first when he was connecting with ... I believe it was a guitar. He was playing music.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>33:26</span> <span>I used to play first. I played classical guitar. I'm sure many people who play musical instruments know that you may train and train and train on a piece during the day, and you get better for sure. But you're never perfect. And then you sleep over it. The next day, you wake up, you play it again and now it's smooth and it flows beautifully. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>33:53</span> <span>That happened to you?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>33:54</span> <span>It happened to me. It happens to lots of people.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 31:</span> <span>33:55</span> <span>That happened to me all the time. I discovered that sometimes if I worked on a piece and put it away, went to bed and got some rest, I had it better learned than if I stayed up all night cramming.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>rob:</span> <span>34:08</span> <span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 31:</span> <span>34:09</span> <span>Definitely. There's one story, and I haven't thought about this for a long time. But first of all, Rob and I play in a band together.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>rob:</span> <span>34:16</span> <span>The band is called the Sisterhood of Convoluted Thinkers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 31:</span> <span>34:19</span> <span>And we switch instruments like a lot.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>rob:</span> <span>34:21</span> <span>She's usually the bass player.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 31:</span> <span>34:22</span> <span>I was gonna play drums.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>rob:</span> <span>34:22</span> <span>So she had to learn how to play drums.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 31:</span> <span>34:24</span> <span>So we rented a cabin.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>rob:</span> <span>34:25</span> <span>We went somewhere to rehearse and at night she was really just kind of practicing and practicing and trying to get this rhythm. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 31:</span> <span>34:31</span> <span>This one particular beat, I worked on it a lot. I just keep going and going and-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>rob:</span> <span>34:36</span> <span>I remember playing that one thing again and again and again. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 31:</span> <span>34:40</span> <span>Yeah. And I finally just gave up and went to sleep. And the next morning, I got up and went straight to the kit and I just played it immediately. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>rob:</span> <span>34:50</span> <span>The butt hit the stool and she was going. She could just do it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 31:</span> <span>34:57</span> <span>I thought it was magic. That you can just learn stuff in your sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>35:02</span> <span>So in the middle of the night, somehow the things that your fingers did repeatedly and the notes that you were using to propel your fingers, all those things somehow got better learned. So you learned overnight or you ... you remember better in the morning?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>35:20</span> <span>What happens is that the next day you're a bit better off. What happens during the night to make you better off is [inaudible 00:35:27]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>35:27</span> <span>Tenonie's contention is that sleep helps you remember by forgetting.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>35:35</span> <span>I don't know what that means.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>35:35</span> <span>Let me explain to you what he's saying. He says there's a limited amount of space in your brain.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>35:40</span> <span>The real estate in the brain is pretty limited.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>35:42</span> <span>A limited amount.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>35:43</span> <span>That makes sense. It's a small little guy up there.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>35:45</span> <span>Yup. And yet every experience you have during the day-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>35:48</span> <span>Is going to take away some space.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>35:49</span> <span>-uses up a little of what you got. When you are awake, inevitably, you learn. Whether you want it or not. You are going around talking to me, having breakfast, going to work and yakking on the phone with your friends, talking to your mom, very different from the friends, then going home, taking a bath. Gotta take a bath.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>36:10</span> <span>Yeah, I get it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>36:11</span> <span>Everything you do during the day, every thought you think, no matter how small, it all causes your brain to form new connections. This conversation, as we're having it is reshaping my brain. Little pathways are forming that weren't there before I sat down. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>36:25</span> <span>Exactly. Whether we recognize it or not, lots of things are going to change your brain by the end of the waking day. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>36:32</span> <span>So if in the middle of the afternoon you sit down with your guitar and you practice the guitar intently, those two hours, you're also making connections. And because you're concentrating, maybe you're making more connections than usual. These are guitar connections. And all those synaptic connections made during the day, one upon the other, upon the other, by the time you're ready for sleep at the end of the day, up in your head it's a giant unruly mess. And that is where we think sleep kicks in. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Well, I'm gonna guess here, but I think you think that sleep is a garbage detail that comes in and says, \"Okay, you're done, you're done, you're done ... \"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>37:20</span> <span>It's actually even simpler than that.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>37:21</span> <span>According to Tenonie, there's not really a janitor who comes in and decides \"Okay, you have to leave, you get to stay.\" Nothing like that. Instead, he says what happens ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>37:29</span> <span>We think that during sleep ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>37:32</span> <span>Waves of electrical activity, kind of like a late evening bath, wash over your head. They start at the back of your head and they move to the front.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>37:41</span> <span>These waves are called slow oscillations.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>37:44</span> <span>And over the course of the night ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>37:46</span> <span>One thousand times a night ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>37:47</span> <span>Those waves wash through all the experiences of your day, all the little synaptic connections that you made all day long and everyone of those connections, all of them, gets just a little bit softer.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>38:00</span> <span>They get weaker, progressively, gracefully, they get weaker.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>38:02</span> <span>Even, he says, the things you wanna hold onto, like the guitar.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Wait a second. Wait a second. You were the one who said you learned how to play the instrument in the afternoon. You went to sleep and you play the instrument better in the morning. Why would you wake up the next morning playing better? You should play more weakly, with less confidence, and less memory. Because after all, you've just given the whole place a bath.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>38:26</span> <span>It's all relative, Sir. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>38:28</span> <span>What he means by relative is this. That mess of new connections in your head, some of those connections are softer, some of those connections were louder, the random things you ordered for lunch, they're softer. But the guitar, because you spend so much time thinking about guitar technique, you spend so much energy on it, that's louder. So we're just measuring connections here. Now imagine that sleep is a big volume knob. So listen to what happens when you lower the volume the whole day. Lower and lower and lower. Now you hear how the softer stuff just falls away, you can't hear it anymore? But the guitar, while it's getting softer too because it was so loud to begin with, now it stands out a bit more clearly. No?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>39:14</span> <span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>39:15</span> <span>The signal. The signals that have survived reasonably well are heard better because his background has become more silent.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>39:21</span> <span>So your ability to play the guitar better the next morning is not because you've learned these skills overnight that you didn't have before, it's because all the other stuff taking up your brain has gone down in volume and you're left with relatively speaking, a better guitar fingering technique.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Dr. Julio tenon:</span> <span>39:39</span> <span>You put your finger on it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>39:42</span> <span>So Mr Tenonie feels that sleep is a little bit like wind and rain, like the process of erosion. At the end of the day, or rather at the beginning of the morning, the things left standing are the things you need to know.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>40:11</span> <span>We should go to break.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>40:11</span> <span>Okay, so coming up next, for those of us who can get to sleep, next, our chance to dream. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>40:17</span> <span>This is Radiolab.

Do you know that story about the benzene molecule?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>40:58</span> <span>No.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>40:58</span> <span>Speaking of dreams. Well, here-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>41:01</span> <span>The benzene molecule?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>41:01</span> <span>1865. German chemist is trying to figure out the shape of this molecule, benzene. He knows it has a certain amount of one kind of atom and a certain amount of another, but he can't figure out how they all link up. And he's tortured by this problem. Goes to sleep, has a dream of a snake biting its tail. Wakes up, bolts right up and says, \"it's a ring. It's a ring.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>41:25</span> <span>Do you believe that?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>41:26</span> <span>I want to.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>41:27</span> <span>Well, yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>41:28</span> <span>I mean, don't get me wrong. I hate it when people tell me their dreams. Hate it. I wanna stab my eye with a fork when people tell me their dreams. I don't know why-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>41:35</span> <span>Well, I'm never gonna tell you about my dreams again.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>41:37</span> <span>Good.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>41:38</span> <span>But, no, you're not alone. Because for a long time, scientists have avoided studying dreams because they think they're so random and meaningless and study-able. But we did meet a guy ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>41:50</span> <span>I'm Bob Stickgold, S-T-I-C-K-G-O-L-D. I'm an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>41:57</span> <span>Who found an interesting way to ask the question ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>41:59</span> <span>Why do we dream?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>42:01</span> <span>Simple question. Very hard answer.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Stickgold was one of the first modern scientists to take dreams seriously. And for him, it actually began kinda by accident. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>42:12</span> <span>I'd been up in Vermont with my family. We had gone and climbed Camel's Hump, one of the higher, easy to climb mountains in Vermont. We'd gone at 8:00 in the morning, we were back at 2:00 in the afternoon.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>42:24</span> <span>And for that whole day, he'd been up climbing on the rocks, gripping them with his hands, really climbing. Later that night ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>42:31</span> <span>I lie down, I close my eyes, I can feel the rocks under my hands and I sort of startle up and I say, \"whoa. That's really bizarre.\" It wasn't like I was thinking about it. I was there, I could feel the rock. I'd been off the mountain for eight hours. Nothing like that had happened. I lie down on the bed for three minutes, starting to go to sleep and boom it's there. And I try it again and I fell asleep. Two hours later I wake up, have to go to the bathroom. I go to the bathroom, I come back and I say, \"That was way cool. I have to try that again.\" And I cannot get it back. What happened in those two hours to those memories that they won't intrude anymore? And then I started talking to friends and they said, \"Oh try canoeing.\" Or someone else says, \"Try white water rafting if you wanna get that.\" And someone else says, \"Oh, hello. Take organic chemistry.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span>And you go to bed at night and all you see are these spreading molecules rotating in front of your eyes. Those daytime activities are affecting your dreams. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>43:41</span> <span>And that got him thinking. What exactly is the connection between what you do during the day and what you dream at night? </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>43:48</span> <span>What are the rules of that? He figured, all right, this replay is kind of interesting. Maybe I'll test it. But how? If I get some subjects together, what could I have them do during the day that would reliably end up in their dreams?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>44:02</span> <span>Well he can't have them all go for hike. And they're probably not gonna get permission to take them white water rafting.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>44:08</span> <span>Too expensive.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>44:08</span> <span>So what could he do?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>44:09</span> <span>Sort of sat fallow for a year. And I was moaning to some of my students about how can't think of how to do this and someone says, \"Tetris\". And somebody else says, \"Absolutely\". And I'm saying, \"What? What?\" He said, \"Well, don't you play Tetris?\" And I say, \"Yes\" \"Well, when you start playing Tetris ... \" It turns out when you start playing Tetris and you go to bed at night, you lie down in bed, and you see Tetris pieces falling down in front of your eyes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>44:47</span> <span>Sure.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>44:47</span> <span>Sure?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>44:48</span> <span>Oh, yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>44:48</span> <span>You knew that?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>44:49</span> <span>Absolutely. [crosstalk 00:44:51]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>44:50</span> <span>You guys both know that?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>44:51</span> <span>Oh yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>44:54</span> <span>I got a cover of a science magazine for the first published paper on dreaming in 40 years because I discovered that and everybody already knew it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>45:07</span> <span>It was that simple. He got a bunch of people, put them in a room, had them play Tetris, later that night they woke up and 60% of them were dreaming of Tetris. 60%.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>45:18</span> <span>How do you know that, just from their reports?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>45:20</span> <span>As they were falling asleep, we're monitoring them electrophysiologically and as they start to drift off to sleep, please report now.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>45:33</span> <span>This Tetris observation was a pretty good start in terms of getting at that question.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>45:37</span> <span>Why do we dream?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>45:38</span> <span>Why do we dream? How does it work? What if, as a next step, instead of having the people report their own dreams, waking them up and doing that whole thing, what if instead, you could cut the person out of the equation entirely and go right to the source? To the dream directly.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>45:53</span> <span>I'm Matt Wilson. I'm a researcher here at MIT and I'm a neuro scientist studying learning and memory.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>45:59</span> <span>That's what Matt Wilson does. He takes us to the dream lab.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>46:04</span> <span>So when we first come in, what we see is this bank on monitors. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>46:08</span> <span>13 monitors, all in a row.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>46:09</span> <span>Each monitor displaying ongoing activity in the brain. Little panels, each panel showing these ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>46:16</span> <span>It's like the Kennedy Space Center, really. All the monitors have data just flashing all over them. Graphs and squiggly lines and numbers. It's not immediately clear where all this information is coming from. But if you peek around the back, you'll see that all the computer wires go to one box, which then connects to a cable, which then goes up to the ceiling, over to a wall and down into the head, into the head of one tiny rat, who's just kinda hanging out in his own little basket.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>46:44</span> <span>See him just resting. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>46:45</span> <span>Is that the little guy, himself?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>46:46</span> <span>Yeah, that's him.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>46:48</span> <span>He looks pretty normal, except for this cable coming out of his skull. And the cable is basically a microphone or a bunch of them which Matt uses to eavesdrop on the brain cells inside the rat's head as they chitchat. And this is what that sounds like. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>47:06</span> <span>You can hear this kinda snap, crackle, pop sound. These are individual cells that are firing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>47:12</span> <span>Like ... right there. One does.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>47:15</span> <span>That kind of whooshing sound. I can tell this animal's sitting, resting quietly. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>47:23</span> <span>Amazingly, he says this while he has his back to the animal. He is so fluent with the morse code language of the rat's brain cells, he doesn't even have to actually look at the animal to know what it's doing. He can just instantly decode all of that snapping. Kind of like that guy in the Matrix, the bald guy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>47:39</span> <span>I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>47:43</span> <span>Just by listening, Matt knows when the animal is sitting. He knows when it is sleeping. He knows when it's running around in a maze. He even can tell which direction it's running.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>47:52</span> <span>It just happened that as we were studying these patterns while the animal ran around, after the experiments, the animals would get tired. They would go to sleep. I would be there in the room, but I would continue to listen to the activity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Notice how it's gotten silent?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>48:06</span> <span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>48:06</span> <span>I began to notice that when the animals were asleep, the brain cells weren't just firing randomly. In fact, when the animals would go into REM sleep ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>So now he is going into REM right now.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The pattern of activity we'd hear ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Notice that it's not these whooshes anymore.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It sounded very much like the pattern that the animal had just been running through. Like if you weren't watching the animal you would think, \"Oh, the animal has gotten up and is running around again\" but then you turn and you look and you see the animal is asleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>48:35</span> <span>He checked the data and it wasn't simply that the rat was running around in it's mind while it's body was asleep. It seemed to be running a specific route. The same route, in fact, that it had run earlier in the day.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>48:45</span> <span>The same sequence, same order, same everything?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>48:48</span> <span>Yes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>48:49</span> <span>It was re-running its maze. Step for step. So then he asked the next question.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>48:55</span> <span>Are they seeing the things that they saw while they were awake? We actually look into these questions as a rat.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>49:01</span> <span>And?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>49:02</span> <span>So the answer we see evidence of replay in basically all of the parts of the brain that we have looked in.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>49:08</span> <span>They see the maze that they ran through? The very same maze?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>49:10</span> <span>Yes, they see the maze.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>49:11</span> <span>Because that is dreaming, in a sense.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>49:12</span> <span>Well, how do we define dreaming? </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>49:15</span> <span>Sounds like dreaming to me. I don't know. But the question remains, why would the rat or any creature do this? And so Matt came up with a simple next experiment. He decided to give the rat two mazes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>49:27</span> <span>What would that do to it's dreams of the night? Or whatever you wanna call them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>49:30</span> <span>If they run on maze number one and then on maze number two, we see them running maze one and maze two together in a way that they did not experience when they were awake.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>49:41</span> <span>So it's like a remix, a new pattern that includes part of maze one and part of maze two.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>49:46</span> <span>Precisely.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>49:47</span> <span>It turns out that when the rat had more than one maze in its memory, it began to invent completely new mazes.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>49:53</span> <span>Oh, wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>49:54</span> <span>This gives us the thought that sleep has this unique opportunity to basically run through events to put them together in ways that may not have occurred while the animals were awake. And that's what learning really is. Learning is about synthesis, about taking things that were apparently unrelated and figuring out the connection in those, figuring out the rules, the hidden rules, the undiscovered rules that will allow us to create something new. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>50:23</span> <span>I think dreaming is a time when we try out possibilities that in waking we might not feel were worth trying. And when it really works, it can be profoundly important. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>50:36</span> <span>If Robert Stickgold is right, then how does this solving the problem thing, how does it work? How does the brain decide what to put into a dream and what to leave out of the dream?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>50:48</span> <span>One of the interesting things about dreams is that people don't have dreams where they're word processing, where they're surfing the net. These things that they spend huge amounts of their day doing don't get into their dreams.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>51:00</span> <span>But somehow Tetris gets in there every time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>51:03</span> <span>Every time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>51:03</span> <span>And why would that be?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>51:05</span> <span>Well, he has a hunch.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>51:06</span> <span>Which he's actually exploring with a completely different video game.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>51:08</span> <span>We've moved to a game called Alpine Racer, which we bought out of an arcade.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>51:13</span> <span>Which he showed us. Took us down the hall to the game room.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>51:17</span> <span>Here we are.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>51:18</span> <span>And there, in the corner it stood.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>51:21</span> <span>Mockingly. Oh wow, it's a full body game. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>51:24</span> <span>Please step up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>51:25</span> <span>I stepped up to the game, got on the platform.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>51:28</span> <span>It's still warming up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>51:29</span> <span>And then I set off down a virtual mountain. All right, I'm going down the hill. I am also a girl. I am also avoiding the ... oh, I'm doing a nice little turn there. Be careful of the wall. Straight down ahead. And down we go. Ahhh! Oh no! A tree! Ahhh! We're now gonna go through the tunnel. This is ... Ow! Oh, that hurt!</span></p>\r\n<p><span>As you can hear, this game was really stressful, which is by design. Robert Stickgold has the theory that as you go through your day, your brain's constantly keeping track of emotion, that's the thing, emotional content, like when you run into a virtual tree, for example. Your brain is gonna flag that stuff. It's gonna flag that it's important. It says, \"Ooh, I need to remember this so I can work on it later. I'm gonna put a sticky on this one.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>52:19</span> <span>So if it puts a sticky on everything that's heard during the day, then all the brain has to do when it's creating a dream is go and grab stickies.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>52:28</span> <span>Oh, I died. But I died nice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>52:32</span> <span>Just for the record, you got further than Jad on your first try. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>52:36</span> <span>Wow. Wow, it's like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>52:39</span> <span>Then it's over. You know?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>52:41</span> <span>Could you say that again?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>52:42</span> <span>So you have people play Alpine Racer for 45 minute bursts throughout the day, what happens next? Do you wake them up?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>52:48</span> <span>We monitor their brain activity, and just as they're falling asleep, within the first two minutes after they fall asleep, we'll wake them up. There's a microphone right next to them on their bed. And they just report what was going through their minds.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 36:</span> <span>53:05</span> <span>I was just thinking about skiing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>53:08</span> <span>And we get on the first night, up to 40% of all the reports being about skiing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 36:</span> <span>53:14</span> <span>And the game that I've been playing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>53:19</span> <span>40%. Almost half of them. And that's right up there, what I would expect to see after trauma with something that's been labeled so intensely that the brain says, \"Okay, it's obvious what's on the agenda for tonight.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>53:33</span> <span>Stickgold thinks he's seeing the outline of the dream making process here. It starts really simply, the very beginning of sleep, like right after you fall asleep, with the replay. This, he suspects. Is just the brain emptying out it's stickies. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>53:46</span> <span>Things that really intrigued me during the day, that I felt during the day.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>53:49</span> <span>Yeah. But-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>53:50</span> <span>What happens if we let the people go to sleep, sleep two hours, like I did in that very first time after climbing the mountain, wake them up after two hours of sleep ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>54:01</span> <span>Because remember, he couldn't get back the memory of the rocks after he'd spent two hours asleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>54:06</span> <span>That's right.

I was about to say a downhill banana.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 38:</span> <span>54:32</span> <span>I was thinking about skateboarding. I was thinking about doing-</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 37:</span> <span>54:34</span> <span>I was thinking about a bunch of bananas.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Speaker 39:</span> <span>54:36</span> <span>Doing yoga on a ski slope. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>54:37</span> <span>Somebody else had a dream that they were rushing through a forest with their body incredibly stiff and their legs not moving at all as if they were on a conveyor belt.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>54:48</span> <span>It's like as the dream goes on, the brain is starting to free associate. What do I have in my past that has anything to do with mountains and anything to do with crashing or skiing, anything at all that can help me?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>55:00</span> <span>What do I have in all my memories, in my case, for the last 60 years that fits associatively, thematically?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>55:08</span> <span>And the result? Well it might seem random, it is. But every so often, he says, you come up with the right answer.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Bob Stickgold.:</span> <span>55:14</span> <span>So now we get to your dreams of people discovering the structure of benzene. Kekule was his name.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>55:22</span> <span>Kekule actually was his name. I'll guess Kekule.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>55:25</span> <span>That's close.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>55:25</span> <span>He was the German guy I talked about earlier who had a dream of a snake eating its tail and realized from that dream that the shape of the benzene molecule is a ring. I don't know if that dream is true, but maybe that is in fact the point of dreaming. It's this time when you shut off the outside, turn inside, take the problems that you've got and start to really work on them, pull them apart. Make connections that you wouldn't normally make during the day. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Robert Krulwich:</span> <span>55:52</span> <span>However, have you ever wondered why it would be necessary when solving problems like this to dream so vividly? Are you at all puzzled by the super duper technicolor extraordinarily cinematic qualities of some of these things? Because if it were just an everyday brain function to sort of make sense of the world and that would allow you to make new connections, you really wouldn't need quite the movie quality. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>56:18</span> <span>So, when we talk about dreams, what seems to come into dreams are memories, concepts, relationships, associations that have a strong emotional flavor and I'm guessing from the data, need a full blown orchestration to be properly processed. And it is, it's technicolor, the colors are overwhelming almost.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>56:42</span> <span>So if I hear you right, what you're saying to Robert's question about why are the dreams so vivid, is that I don't know but maybe the vividness helps.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Matt Wilson:</span> <span>56:51</span> <span>That whole long answer is what a Harvard Professor says instead of saying I don't know. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Jad Abumrad:</span> <span>57:00</span> <span>I guess we should wrap up.

By 2050, the world population will reach nearly 10 billion and food production will need to grow by 70%. So what if artificial intelligence could help? Farmers are already using it to help increase crop fields. Watson and the IBM cloud provide access to weather data and analyze satellite imagery to help them monitor soil moisture levels and reduce water waste. So as the population grows, more food can be put on tables. So let's put smart to work and find out how at ibm.com/smart. </span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>",

But step out on the sidewalk, and you can see and feel it. Two physicists explain one tidy mathematical formula that they believe holds the key to what drives a city. Yet math can't explain most of the human-scale details that make urban life unique. So we head out in search of what the numbers miss, and meet a reluctant city dweller, a man who's walked 700 feet below Manhattan, and a once-thriving community that's slipping away.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><span><span>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this program indicated that the Dow Jones Industrial Average originated in the 1920’s.

He wanted to make a living at it, so he bounced around for a bit.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>So I finally-</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>And then finally, at age 30...</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>There was no place to go, except for New York.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>Wait, so it wasn't a matter that you wanted to live in New York-</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>No, I didn't want to live in New York.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>... it was more so New York was your last option?</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>It was my last option.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>And he hated it.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>Because it was ugly to me. Too many humans, too much concrete.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>One theory about autism is that the things that come into an autistic kid's brain all have equal value. They don't know how to sort through it. When I first came to New York, it was really... It was pretty overwhelming. I had decided to leave, for sure.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>But then, take us to the roof.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>I was lucky when I first moved here.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>So he's staying with a friend who lives in this big building in Brooklyn Heights.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>Right across from the Twin Towers and it's 36 stories high.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>And he decides one lonely night to go up onto the roof.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>And there's this intense fog. The Twin Towers, the bottom of them was covered in the fog, but not the top, so it was like they were floating and there's a little cuticle, sliver of moon in the sky, and the foghorns are going and the boats are slowly moving. There's this breeze. I had this brass penny whistle that my father had given me, and I was standing there and I was playing it and suddenly something clicked. I was like, \"Oh, those are all the bridges. That's the Williamsburg Bridge, that's the Manhattan Bridge, there's the Brooklyn Bridge. That's New York. It's small now.\"</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>I'm looking at the Statue of Liberty and my grandmother Anastasia Panny came from Albania and they went to Ellis Island. I could see my history there too and it suddenly hit me, like, \"Oh my goodness. This is like a coral reef. You can't see the people, but look at this beautiful structure they have created.\"</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>That fog and that air, it was just the whole city was breathing. Nature was breathing. Everything was breathing and I felt connected on a spiritual level to the city for the first time.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And so, Skip decided to stay.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>For a while.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>For a while.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>All over the world people are now moving, of course. We know this from the country to the city. At this point...</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>The world, two years ago crossed this extraordinary benchmark...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>That's physicist Jeff West.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>... where more than half the planet is now urbanized.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>51%.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And that made us wonder, how do cities work?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Is there some deep, organic logic that holds all these people together?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Or, as writer [Joe Nalara 00:04:10] puts it-</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Are cities just...</p>\r\n<p>Joe Nalara:</p>\r\n<p>These tumors of people on the landscape?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>I'm Jad Abumrad.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>I'm Robert Krulwich.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This is Radiolab, and our topic today...</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Cities.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Cities.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>I love them but I don't know why.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>All right. So, in talking about cities, it was kind of hard to know where to start, because every city has its own...</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>DNA, kind of.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, its own unique feel.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>For instance, let me just give you my own stupid example here. Every time I go to St. Louis to visit my mom-</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>...I'm on the plane, I'm in my own kind of groove and I step off the plane into the airport and it's just like, with the first step, just hit this wall of... Something is different. You feel the difference in your bones.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Because?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Well, that's the question. Is he there?</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>I'm here.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>What gives a city its feel? Oh, is this Mr. Bob Levine?</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>This is Mr. Bob Levine.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Bob Levine is a professor of psychology.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>California State University.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And he thinks the answer to that question is time.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>Time.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>That each city warps time in its own unique way.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>My cities are my subjects.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>He studied this idea for the past 30 years in all kinds of different ways.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>We looked at things like percentage of people wearing watches.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>How long does it take bank tellers in each city to change a $20 bill.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Really?</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, and then we looked at talking speed.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Really?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Talking speed.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, we'd get on the phone and call post offices, since that seemed like something that would be available every place and make a standard request. Would you tell me the difference between regular mail, certified mail, and insured mail?</p>\r\n<p>Postal Worker 1:</p>\r\n<p>Okay, certified is when you just need someone to sign for it.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Then he says they'd calculate...</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>The number of syllables per second.</p>\r\n<p>Postal Worker 1:</p>\r\n<p>Regular mail just goes air mail, if it's out of Utah.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>2.73 syllables per second.</p>\r\n<p>Postal Worker 2:</p>\r\n<p>Then if you want the return receipt card to come back to your house...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Springfield, Mass.</p>\r\n<p>Postal Worker 2:</p>\r\n<p>You pay an extra 70 cents. You understand?</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>Yes.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>3.45 syllables per second.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And this one?</p>\r\n<p>Postal Worker 3:</p>\r\n<p>Certified is when you want...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Not really sure where it's from because the tape lost the ID, but it could be Nashville.</p>\r\n<p>Postal Worker 3:</p>\r\n<p>... proof of mailing and then you want to know who... You want a return receipt.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And if it is Nashville...</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>2.65 syllables per second.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>Slow.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Well Springfield is like [inaudible 00:06:40]. But the whole talking thing was just really a prelude for Bob. It got him into what I think he's most known for.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>And what we find most fascinating.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>We actually looked at walking speed.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Walking!</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Walking.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah. Well, what I would do is I would get into a new city.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 1 - Mumbai:</p>\r\n<p>And I'm in Mumbai, India.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 2 - Jerusalem:</p>\r\n<p>Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 3 - Buenos Aries:</p>\r\n<p>Buenos Aires City.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 4 - Chiang Mai:</p>\r\n<p>Ching Mai, Thailand.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>We actually put out a call to Radiolab listeners everywhere...</p>\r\n<p>Listener 5 - Liberia:</p>\r\n<p>We're in Buchanan in Liberia.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>...to help us repeat the study.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 6 - Dublin:</p>\r\n<p>Okay, good morning Radiolab. I'm recording from Dublin, in Ireland.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 7 - Oslo:</p>\r\n<p>Downtown Oslo.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 8 - Copenhagen:</p>\r\n<p>Copenhagen.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>I would get into a new city and-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Step one.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>... I would scope out main business and shopping areas.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 9:</p>\r\n<p>I'm in [inaudible 00:07:18].</p>\r\n<p>Listener 10:</p>\r\n<p>[inaudible 00:07:18].</p>\r\n<p>Listener 11:</p>\r\n<p>[inaudible 00:07:18] Street.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Step two, get out some string.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>A roll of string?</p>\r\n<p>Listener 8 - Copenhagen:</p>\r\n<p>My red string.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>60 feet long.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 6 - Dublin:</p>\r\n<p>20 meters we use over here, we wouldn't say feet really.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Step three, use that string to measure out the distance.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 8 - Copenhagen:</p>\r\n<p>Now I just have to roll out the string.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Now do you tape the one end to the sidewalk?</p>\r\n<p>Listener 11:</p>\r\n<p>I would just make more.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Step four, go under cover.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>Get in a corridor and-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Be cool. Act like you're reading a paper.</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>... or waiting for somebody.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 8 - Copenhagen:</p>\r\n<p>All right. Found myself a discrete place.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 10:</p>\r\n<p>I think I found a pretty nice spot here.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Do you use a stopwatch?</p>\r\n<p>Bob Levine:</p>\r\n<p>I would use a stopwatch.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 6 - Dublin:</p>\r\n<p>The stopwatch, with its trusty beep. Watch is working.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Ready? (singing)</p>\r\n<p>Listener 10:</p>\r\n<p>Okay, I'm ready now.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 6 - Dublin:</p>\r\n<p>And go. (singing) And it all goes quiet the minute I want to start. Brilliant, thanks Dublin.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This experiment was actually harder than you would think.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Much harder.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 8 - Copenhagen:</p>\r\n<p>Radiolab people, this is not very easy to do.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Timing was an issue. People trying to sell you stuff.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 6 - Dublin:</p>\r\n<p>No, no, no. I don't need a shoe shine.</p>\r\n<p>Shoe Shiner:</p>\r\n<p>Very good shine. Look at my color.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 6 - Dublin:</p>\r\n<p>No. Pigeons don't count. No, pigeons don't count.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Okay. All together now.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>All together now. (singing).</p>\r\n<p>Listener 8 - Copenhagen:</p>\r\n<p>Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 11:</p>\r\n<p>Step. Step.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Actually, it didn't sound like that at all. They weren't in sync, as you can imagine. Every city had its own beat.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 11:</p>\r\n<p>Start. [crosstalk 00:08:39] Step, step, step, step, step, step, step.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Which on some level we knew. But still the range was pretty amazing.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 7 - Oslo:</p>\r\n<p>Stop. 12.2.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Oslo.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 1 - Mumbai:</p>\r\n<p>14.4 second.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Mumbai.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 5 - Liberia:</p>\r\n<p>27 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Buchanan, Liberia.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 5 - Liberia:</p>\r\n<p>Wow.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 3 - Buenos Aries:</p>\r\n<p>13.8.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Buenos Aries.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 11:</p>\r\n<p>12.13.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Mexico City.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 8 - Copenhagen:</p>\r\n<p>10.1 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Copenhagen.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 4 - Chiang Mai:</p>\r\n<p>21.5 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Chiang Mai.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 10:</p>\r\n<p>11.57</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Portland.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 2 - Jerusalem:</p>\r\n<p>15 and a half seconds.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Just to break it down. On the high end you've got...</p>\r\n<p>Listener 6 - Dublin:</p>\r\n<p>Step. Steps. You're on it. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>The Dubliners.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 6 - Dublin:</p>\r\n<p>Okay, she was 9.5. And that's 10.4</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Who take, on average, 10.76 seconds to cover 60 feet.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Compare that to Buchanan, Liberia.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 5 - Liberia:</p>\r\n<p>Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Looking around, something actually on the head. She got a tiny pink blouse.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Whose walkers covered the same distance in about...</p>\r\n<p>Listener 5 - Liberia:</p>\r\n<p>21 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>21 seconds. So if you want to think about it in football terms, by the time the Dubliner has scored a touchdown...</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>The guy from Buchanan, Liberia is somewhere I guess around midfield. Oh my god.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And the spooky thing, according to Bob Levine, if you do these under the same conditions, same place, you will get the same time. These times don't change. Dublin is always about this.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 6 - Dublin:</p>\r\n<p>Step. Step. You're on it. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>And Buchanan, Liberia is always around this.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 5 - Liberia:</p>\r\n<p>Step. Step. Step. Step.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Manhattan, as we found, is right about here usually. Step. Step. Step. With thunder. Step. Step. Step in pink. No Dublin, but not bad.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>But why the consistency? What is it that makes that walking speed? Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Where does it come from?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>I mean, is anybody beating the drum? How well can you change the walking speed? Say a bunch of us got together and decided we were just going to up it my five percent on a given day. Would we get everybody to do it and would they even notice the difference?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Do we make the city? Or does the city make us?</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Thank you to our walkers.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 3 - Buenos Aries:</p>\r\n<p>Milena in Buenos Aires.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 5 - Liberia:</p>\r\n<p>Mustafa [inaudible 00:10:46], Liberia.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 2 - Jerusalem:</p>\r\n<p>[inaudible 00:10:47], Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 8 - Copenhagen:</p>\r\n<p>Mira Killaman in Copenhagen.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 7 - Oslo:</p>\r\n<p>Marta, Oslo.</p>\r\n<p>Listener 9:</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott.

Okay, so getting back to that question I asked a second ago.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Why is it that cities develop particular beats?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>I mean, is it because the city does it to the people?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Or the people do it to the city?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah. We ran into a couple of guys who may at least have the start of an answer.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Yes.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>A couple of physicists, oddly enough, named Jeffrey West and Luis Betancourt.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>This is Jeffrey and there's Luis on the other side of the table.</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>I'm here as well.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Cool.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>They're at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Lots of mesas and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Nothing like the cities we just visited.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>It's almost biblical in its expanse.</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, the blue skies just kind of make you brave and contemplative and all those good things.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Brave enough in fact to claim from their high desert perch that these beats, the meter of every city that we've just been to actually has underneath it a kind of logic.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>If you tell me the average speed of walking in some City X.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Take Rochester, New York where people walk at about this beat.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>60 feet in 12.67 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>If you don't tell them Rochester, you just tell him the number of beats, he will tell you...</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>The population is maybe one and a quarter million people.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Actual population, 1.03 million people.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>And the average wage, about $60,000 a year.</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>Actual average wage, [$50,588 [00:12:36].</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Wow.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Let me ask you a precise question.

Can you tell me how many libraries there are?</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>Yes, we can tell you how many you should expect.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Wow.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>How many things can you count when you're-</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>Oh, presumably an infinite number but it's limited by the things for which there are data.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>They've got data from the US Census.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>That's Jonah Lehrer. He's written about Luis and Jeff and he's the one who kind of got us thinking about all this.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>Japan.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>In China.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>Data from-</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>Sociological surveys. Some data on cell phones.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>And when they put all these numbers together, they discovered a deep pattern.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Call comes from the footsteps.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>No, not the footsteps. Even the footsteps are a reflection of this deep and fundamental pattern that governs everything. Just one fact.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>What is it?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>You really want to know?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, what is it?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Size.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>The size.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>How many people live there.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Size matters. Size is the largest determinant of all characteristics of the city.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>They would say, \"Tell me the size of the city and I can explain the vast majority of all these different variables that we can measure.\"</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Right.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>As a city scales up, they say...</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>From 100,000 to 200,000, one million to two million, from five million to ten million...</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Everything about it, all those things that they've been measuring, they scale up too but they scale up-</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>According to a very simple mathematical formula. It does not matter that New York has big skyscrapers and is on the ocean and that Boise is in the Rocky Mountains, that San Francisco is on San Francisco Bay.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait. That can't be. That can't be. No, I was with you right up to that last point. I mean, you go to the Midwest and it's landlocked and then you go to a port city and it's on a port. That's got to matter.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>It matters, but these actually are superficial effects and account for only 10, 20 percent of their variation.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>What they're saying is that those specificities, the local history is in large part insignificant and it is completely overwhelmed by these generic laws of urban scaling. That to me is a very interesting and surprising idea, simply because we don't think of cities like that at all.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>No, we certainly do not.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>That's because you're not a physicist, so you don't think abstractly in that regard.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Well, why should I?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Because sometimes it can be very useful. Remember, what these guys have done is they've just created an average profile for every size city. If you're one million or seven million or twelve million, here's how many things you should have.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Now you can ask, \"Okay, let's look specifically at that city and ask, is it over-performing or under-performing?\"</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>Right.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>So, what are some cities that are over-performing for their size?</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>Of the large cities, San Francisco is quite an innovative city. New York's about average.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>About average?</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>In terms of patents. [crosstalk 00:16:11]</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>New York's below average? Did you just say that?</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>New York produces, roughly speaking, the number of patents it should for a size.</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>You produce, for example, twice as many patents as Boston.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>We do?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Hey, that's something. That's something. [crosstalk 00:16:26].</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>You should've produced many more given the size difference of about-</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>We're just average because they're counting patents. We don't have-</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>This is one of the problems with their larger theory, which is that-</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Pay no attention to that.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>... they're relying on data that the US Census collected, so that's a real blind spot.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>If you're counting fabulous, if we ever can figure out a way to count fabulous.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, because he has a point. You're not taking into account the experience of living in a place.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Well, what a theory cannot do is tell you about the essence of New York, the New Yorkness of New York. So to speak, the soul of the city.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Where does that come from?</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>Who knows? I mean, I think that's such a broad question.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Obviously it has something to do with lots of people being jammed into a tight space, bumping into each other.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>The kind of people who move there.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>What the physicists would call human friction. That's a story you can't really tell in math, but you can hear it. Take Skip. He gave producer Aaron Scott a tour of his block in Brooklyn. Listen to who he bumps into everyday.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>He took us on this tour. First place we went was this Jamaican body shop.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Body shop, as in cars?</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>Collision specialists.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>I mean, it's basically these West Indies, Jamaican guys listening to Reggaeton and hip hop, reggae.</p>\r\n<p>Body Shop Worker:</p>\r\n<p>No, I like our kind of music. It's like...</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>All right, that's one place.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>And across the street from this is Kinderspiel.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>A hidden Orthodox Jewish cookie bakery. Around the corner from that...</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>It's a butcher that sells live goats and chickens.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>And here are the goats.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>On the the corner, the Hispanic Pentecostal Church.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>And every Sunday, they give it up to God with this exceedingly enthusiastic band. I huddle at the window and I think, \"This is the best music in the world.\" I feel that deeply.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>Then across the street from that one is a mosque.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>It's beautiful on the inside. Across the street...</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>There's this big building.</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>And the proprietor of this space is a gay foot fetish film producer.</p>\r\n<p>Speaker 34:</p>\r\n<p>Show me your feet! Show me your feet!</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Wait a second, you've got Jamaicans, Orthodox Jews with the cookies, Hispanics, Jesus, Allah, goats, and gay porn?</p>\r\n<p>Speaker 34:</p>\r\n<p>Show me your feet.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>All on the same block?</p>\r\n<p>Skip Sherry:</p>\r\n<p>Absolutely. For me, that's the hammer and the nails. That's the raw ingredients. Now, I'm going to take that home and I'm going to assemble it into a song.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>When you heard his music, could you hear all that stuff?</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>Some of it is clearer than others. The sounds of the neighborhood, like the Reggaeton music of the West Indies auto body shops, he kind of takes them and then filters it through some device that makes it sound like bells.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Oddly enough, the day that Aaron spoke with Skip was the day Skip decided...</p>\r\n<p>Aaron Scott:</p>\r\n<p>He's leaving New York City and he put in his notice.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Which I guess makes his latest album, Sonic New York, kind of a Dear John letter to the city.

But it's like trying to take a snapshot of something that's growing and...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Changing.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>All the time.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>That feeling that Skip had on the rooftop, like the city was breathing, maybe the city really is.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Like a living thing.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Well, yes, in some ways, that's exactly right. They evolve, they grow.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Think about it, says Jeff West, everyday, every minute becomes energy and...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Food.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Trucks.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Water.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>People.

Energy in, energy out.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>That's just what a city needs to do, says Jeff.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Metabolize food, so to speak, because without that, organisms and cities and so on will simply decay.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>So, how does a city stay alive? What does it really take for a city to grow?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Well, that question got me thinking about New York and led me to a place I'd been wanting to go for awhile.</p>\r\n<p>Speaker 37:</p>\r\n<p>[inaudible 00:23:51]</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>I'm starting to hear the reverb a little bit.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Where are you?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Underground. 100 feet underground. This is the sound of one of New York City's water tunnels. I'm standing in it. It's exactly what you would imagine. A big tube that's about nine feet wide, nine feet up, perfectly polished cement and it seems to just go forever.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This is basically, you might call it a smaller artery inside the city's circulatory system. When this is online in a couple of months, it will pump up to 290 million gallons a day. Something like that, which is an awesome thought in the literal sense of the word.</p>\r\n<p>Catherine Mallen:</p>\r\n<p>When you walk through the streets of Manhattan...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This is Catherine Mallen from the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>\r\n<p>Catherine Mallen:</p>\r\n<p>These water tunnels are anywhere from 200 to 800 feet below your feet. They're silently there and when you turn on your tap...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>When you take a drink, you are basking in a daily convenience that is born from blood, sweat, and death. To explain, you really have to go back to a time when there were no tunnels.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>This would be 1790, 1800 or so.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Around that time, says historian Diane [Galusha 00:25:22], New York's population...</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>Was booming. It tripled in 20 years.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And you suddenly had 100,000 people all getting their water from the same spot.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>A large freshwater pond called The Collect and they had pigs running around by the hundreds and the chamber pots on the streets. There were livestock in Lower Manhattan at the time. People had cows for milk and so, when they died, they had to do something with them, so...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Often, she says, they'd throw their dead cows and everything else...</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>In the pond.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>The same pond that they were drinking from?</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>Right.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>No way. Not surprisingly...</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>As the city grew...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>People got sick.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>In 1798, there was a yellow fever epidemic. Killed a couple of thousand people and cholera and typhoid.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>City officials were like, \"This has to change.\"</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>As if to accentuate the point in 1835, there was this huge fire.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>The fire department rushes out to put out the fire, but they can't.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>It was in December and the rivers froze and they couldn't get water to the fires.</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>If you don't have water to fight the fire, the city burns down.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>It's pretty simple.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, 700 buildings.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>That's our starting point. A New York City that could not grow. By the way, the guy we just heard...</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>John [Chick-Dunahew 00:26:32].</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>He's a Sand Hog, part of the long line of guys who blasted New York out of its poopy pond phase and into its future. Can I ask you a question? Why are you guys called Sand Hogs? Why wouldn't you be called tunnel blasters or earth movers or something that's more... Do you have any idea where that name come from?</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, it comes from the dictionary. Really, and I love the look on people's faces when they ask me that and that's the answer. It's described in Webster's Dictionary as-</p>\r\n<p>Automated Voice:</p>\r\n<p>A laborer who digs or works in sand.</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>The original Sand Hogs were the soft ground guys, compressed air, that's where you-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>To back up for a second, when the city decided to scrap the pond in favor of clean water from upstate, it faced a couple of challenges and this was also true when they designed-</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>The subway system.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Namely, nature. How do you, for example, build a tunnel under a river?</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>Well, they were Sand Hogs. Send them down, they dug. Literally dug with what we call mucksticks, shovels, [inaudible 00:27:31] 60, 50, 100 feet under the bottom of the river.</p>\r\n<p>Nick S.:</p>\r\n<p>Men with shovels, excavating ground.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>That's Nick [Sokol 00:27:40].</p>\r\n<p>Nick S.:</p>\r\n<p>I'm a tunneling engineer. Generally, it's a dark, dank place.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Now, the obvious engineering problems at the river bottom, which is now above their heads, is soft.</p>\r\n<p>Nick S.:</p>\r\n<p>Sands and silts and gravels.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>How do you keep that from not falling on your head?</p>\r\n<p>Nick S.:</p>\r\n<p>That's when compressed air started being used.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>The basic idea, says Nick, is that these huge pumps would basically pump air into the tunnels at such pressure that it would basically push the ceiling up.</p>\r\n<p>Nick S.:</p>\r\n<p>Exactly, so the mud doesn't cave in on you.</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>The compressed air holds that thing from collapsing in on you.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Usually. The engineers on the shore had to get the pressure just right, says Chick, because if they didn't, you'd get this absolutely terrifying situation that is maybe the best cocktail party story ever.</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>We used to give an award. We haven't given it in many years. We call it the Marshall Maybe award. They were doing one of those tunnels to Brooklyn. The men were up in the face of the tunnel, they're digging away.</p>\r\n<p>Nick S.:</p>\r\n<p>And then very suddenly...</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>There's a blow out.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>In the face of the wall, a puncture hole develops. Tiny at first but it quickly becomes-</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>Bigger and bigger.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Until it's the size of-</p>\r\n<p>Nick S.:</p>\r\n<p>Sort of an eye.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Then a whole head and all the compressed air rushes into that hole.</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>It would be like if you shot a hole through an airplane. All the air would...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Hats are flying into this whole, lanterns, shovels, then a guy goes into the whole.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>A guy?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, a human being into the whole and another guy, then a third.</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>The third guy must have been the luckiest Sand Hog in the world.</p>\r\n<p>Nick S.:</p>\r\n<p>This is an article from The New York Times. \"As I struck the mud, it felt as if something was squeezing me tighter than I'd ever been squeezed before.\"</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>He blew through all that 60 feet of muck, then through the river, up to the surface. The pressure blew him right up into the air.</p>\r\n<p>Nick S.:</p>\r\n<p>\"They tell me I was thrown about 25 feet above the water when I came out, but I don't remember that.\" That's remarkable.</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>He came back down and landed right alongside a police boat.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>In the water?</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>In the water. So, they took him, they cleaned him up, he went home, he came to work the next day.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>What?</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>That's why they gave him the award. That's why the award is-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>You're kidding me.</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>No, I'm not kidding you.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>[inaudible 00:30:04] In the early days, no one kept track of how many people died building New York's tunnels. The number is probably in the thousands. So wait, this right here, this plaque that we're looking at...</p>\r\n<p>Richie Fitzsimmons:</p>\r\n<p>This plaque was donated.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This is Richie Fitzsimmons. He's the current head of the Sand Hogs Union and we're standing in front of a big stone plaque with two dozen names on it.</p>\r\n<p>Richie Fitzsimmons:</p>\r\n<p>It's in memory of all the people that we lost in tunnels in New York City since 1970, since we started keeping records. Some more of the photos, come on.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Later, he showed me a picture which really underlined the point. It's a picture of him on his first compressed air job. Oh wow, look at that.</p>\r\n<p>Richie Fitzsimmons:</p>\r\n<p>This is myself.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>He's 19, he's huddled with five other guys and they're in this crowded tunnel and they're all black with soot and he points to each guy in turn.</p>\r\n<p>Richie Fitzsimmons:</p>\r\n<p>Dead, dead, dead, dead, had cancer, is still alive, still alive.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>If you ask any of the Sand Hogs why they do this, mostly they'll tell you, \"We've got to. The city can't grow without its tunnels,\" but you also get answers like this from Chick. He says, \"When you're down there and it's pitch black and you're just walking along...\"</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>You're 600 foot under Manhattan, you're at approximately 30th Street or something, you're in the middle of the greatest city in the world, nobody even knows you exist. Nobody has a clue. It's just beautiful. It's a weird place. It's like being on a planet somewhere.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>He says when he's literally in this rock that is half a billion years old, he sometimes feels very humbled.</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>You're in the middle of the earth. You want to see nature, here it is.</p>\r\n<p>Richie Fitzsimmons:</p>\r\n<p>That's a romantic way of saying it. The human reality of it is...</p>\r\n<p>John C-D:</p>\r\n<p>Here's Richie's take.</p>\r\n<p>Richie Fitzsimmons:</p>\r\n<p>Remember when you were a kid and they used to give you the ant farms and the ant farms were big. We are ants. The ants, there's so fricking many of them that if you got to squish a few, if they've got to use each other to step over each other to keep that whole thing, that's it.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>That doesn't sound very grand the way you're putting it.</p>\r\n<p>Richie Fitzsimmons:</p>\r\n<p>That's reality.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Our job is conquer nature, he says, plain and simple.</p>\r\n<p>Richie Fitzsimmons:</p>\r\n<p>We're builders. Human beings are builders and collectively, there's nothing that we can't do. Nothing.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>October 14th, 1842.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>Oh, it was a huge celebration.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers lined Broadway.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>There was firing of cannons and the ringing of church bells. Fireworks even.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And at the end of it all, says Diane, everybody gathered in City Hall Park.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>They turned a big fountain on and...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Water shot 50 feet into the air. New York City would never be the same. It could finally be a city. But here's where you start to wonder a little bit about the real legacy of cities. What you see almost immediately after this moment, according to Diane, is that water usage-</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>Skyrocketed.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly, you had indoor plumbing.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>All the new buildings were being outfitted with water closets and...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Kids were playing in the hydrants all day long and to make a long story short, just 10 years later, the city is out of water again so they got to build more tunnels and then more and if you follow the water in those tunnels back upstate, you see that the city is gobbling up reservoirs.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>One after another.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Dozens, which meant it had to kick people off that land.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>A thing called imminent domain.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Their villages would have to be-</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>Bulldozed and burned.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Cemeteries.</p>\r\n<p>Diane G.:</p>\r\n<p>Uprooted.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Do you see what's happening? I mean, you could see this city that we live in as a kind of monster. It's just always hungry. Eat, eat, eat. Eat, eat, eat.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Wait a second, because there is another logic available here. If you took all the people in New York City, all those New Yorkers...</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>If you have every inhabitant of New York City suddenly left New York City and moved to small towns all across America, you would need a ton of resources to make that possible.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>That's Jonah Lehrer again, by the way.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>In a sense, New York City saves lots of forests.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Saves lots of water and the reason why, well, that takes us back to Jeff and Luis's ideas about cities.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Well, I suppose-</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Because it all started years ago. Jeff was studying, this time it was living things.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Let's go back to biology for a moment.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>He looked at a huge variety of creatures and for each one, he collected data.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Everything from its metabolic rate to length of its aorta, how quickly it breathes.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>He discovered something kind of fascinating about creatures as they grow bigger and bigger.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>If you double the size of an organism, you double the number of cells that need to be sustained. You would therefore expect that the energy you need to supply would double. You'd double the number of customers, so to speak.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>No.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>No?</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>That is not the case. Instead of doubling, it needs less energy per unit cell to sustain the whole organism. So, there is a kind of-</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Wait a second. That means that the cell is somehow doing more with less?</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Right.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Does that also mean though that an elephant cell somehow is more efficient than a mouse cell?</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>That's correct.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Huh.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>And Jeff says the way they do that is pretty simple. They just move slower.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>They process energy at a slower rate.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>If you take a mouse cell, cell that lives in a mouse and does its work, brings in resources, spits out the waste, brings in more resources, spits out the waste, it does this to a particular beat. But now, says Jeff, if you listen to an elephant's cell, bringing in stuff and pumping out the waste, it's moving obviously slower. So, it's using less energy in a given moment which makes it more efficient.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>What does that have to do with cities?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Turns out, cities work kind of the same way.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>In cities, you see the same kind of efficiency when it comes to infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Electricity.</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>Length of roads.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Water.</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>Length of pipes. Length of electrical cables.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Gasoline.</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>How much gas is consumed.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Here's the point. The bigger the city, the less roads you need per capita.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>What does per capita mean anyways?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Per person.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Per person.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>The less electrical cable lines you need per capita, the less gasoline stations you need per capita, et cetera, et cetera.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Every unit of pipe carries more water or more sewage. Every line of electrical wire carries more-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Right, right. Jeff, does that mean then that if I move to a bigger and bigger city, do I, in a sense, become greener the bigger the city I live in?</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that's a very interesting-</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, it's a very good question.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This is where Luis and Jeff-</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>I think the case is still a little bit out-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And even Jonah.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>It gets complicated when you ask, \"Are people more or less efficient\"-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This is when everybody starts to throw in all these caveats and qualifications.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>All these other variables. [crosstalk 00:37:21]</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Quivocations and ambivalations and prognostications and [dipilations 00:37:24]. Let me just tell you what I think.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>I think you better.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>All right, we all love to talk about how green we are when we live in cities. This is something everybody in the city talks about.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Because we are. Because we take the subway and the bus. [crosstalk 00:37:35] We don't drive and driving is the most energy consuming thing.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Right, but listen to me. The analogy that you just gave me, it does not work. Okay, you said that cells as they go from small bodies to big bodies slow down.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Yep.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Well...</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>Cities, the opposite happens of course. As cities get bigger, each individual unit in that city moves faster.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Thank you, Jonah. We speed up.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>That's true.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>We learned this earlier and this is not trivial, okay? Because as we speed up, we bump into more people, we have more ideas, we invent new things, we want more things. We want more.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>More of everything.</p>\r\n<p>Luis B.:</p>\r\n<p>New tastes, new ideas.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>More interactions, more human friction. More!</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>More choices.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, a better life. That's what a city's all about.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Is there anything wrong with that?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>No, not at all but all I'm saying is there's a cost to it that we don't acknowledge.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>West and Betancourt did this back of the envelope calculation where it's long been known that a body at perfect rest, if you lie in your bed all day in a coma, you will consume about 91 watts of electricity.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>That's called your basal metabolic rate.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>If you're a hunter gatherer living in some tribe in New Zealand, you will consume about 240 watts of electricity everyday.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>The energy just simply to stay alive plus the energy you need to hunt and gather.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>However, if you are living in America, the wattage required to drive your car, run your computer, make your clothes-</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>Heat, air conditioning, being able to go to movies.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>On and on and on.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff West:</p>\r\n<p>All of the various things that constitute our life. If you add all those up...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Your lifestyle requires about 11,000 watts of electricity everyday.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Whoa.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>That's more energy than a blue whale requires.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Some of you listening, particularly if you're an engineer, you may think, \"Wait a second, why are you calling these watts when it's power through a system? Power through a human, call them joules. That's the technically correct word,\" and you'd be right, wouldn't you? But the numbers are the same, so we'll just call them watts.</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>One way to look at what cities have enabled us to do is basically live like 300 million blue whales in America.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Are you sure that cities are causing this development, that it begins and ends with cities?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>You can't assign it all to cities, but that psychology of wanting more, that's a city psychology. That's why people come to cities and then the lifestyle that grows up around that gets broadcast out on TV and radios and movies, which are city industries, out to the country.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>If you just take a historical look at this, the last 300 years have seen more and more consumption, right? And that trend, says Jonah...</p>\r\n<p>Jonah Lehrer:</p>\r\n<p>It's grown in neat parallel with the growth of cities. Cities have enabled that kind of growth.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Even if you guys are right, and we know that half the planet already is living in cities-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>80% of America.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>So yes, there are more people. I'll agree with that.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>More choices.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Asking for-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>More consumption, more energy, more, more, more, more, more.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>Even if that's so, cities, because they also are ingenious and they come up with all these new ideas, maybe cities will solve the problem. Right now, Jad, someone somewhere in Calcutta is about to invent the super light bulb elevator telephone pipe that will make it possible for another 200 [catrillion 00:40:37] people to live together in peace, harmony, and beauty until the next round.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>All right, you go ahead and cling to that optimism.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>And you of course can go hang yourself in the corner. We'll be right back. I'm Robert Krulwich, that's Jad. This is RadioLab.</p>\r\n<p>John:</p>\r\n<p>Hey, this is John calling from the City of Brotherly Love.

If you took 30 cities from the 1920s, I can guarantee you all 30 of those randomly selected cities would still exist on the map and the question is why. Why don't they die like every other social organization?</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>What is it about cities that gives them this crazy persistence?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>That question led us to a place that, by all measures, should've died long ago. A place called [Centralia 00:42:16]. Okay, so we begin on the side of... Where are we?</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>We're on Route 61 in eastern Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Right. This is Pat, by the way. He's a producer at RadioLab.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Hello, hello, hello.</p>\r\n<p>Robert Krulwich:</p>\r\n<p>I know who Pat is, thank you very much.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Anyhow.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>We're waiting for this guy named Tom to meet up with us.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Hey, are you Tom?</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>Yep.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Tom [Hynoski 00:42:40].</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>How you doing? I'm Jad.</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>[inaudible 00:42:41] When did you get here? Just now?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Just now.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>We had asked Tom to show us around his town.</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>Probably the best place to go is up on the hill up there and you can look over everything.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Okay, sure.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>So, we go up on the hill with Tom.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>We actually meet up with another Tom.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>Tom Dempsey. I was the former postmaster here.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>So, we now have two Toms. Tom, Tom.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Very confusing.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Anyhow, the four of us stare down into a valley that used to have a town in it.</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>There was all streets with homes on them all over here.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Now, Centralia is just trees.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>Right down here was the-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Tom 2 points to some trees.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>Our high school. Over here...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>More trees.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>Saint Ignatius Church. [crosstalk 00:43:23] There used to be a playground right at the bottom of this little hill right here. You can still see the bars.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This is where things get a little strange. I mean, right next to the swing set where kids used to laugh their little heads off, there's a hole in the ground.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Right there, I can see some steam coming out of the ground.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Spewing steam. Pat and I would later discover when we got close to it that that steam was really hot.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>It's hot and wet.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Oh my god.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Motherfucker.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Where exactly is the fire?</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>Underneath us.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Like how far?</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>Here? 50 feet maybe.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>So, 50 feet down.</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>If it is.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Can I ask you if the smell doesn't bother you guys?</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>What smell?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>You can smell it. It smells like burning tires here.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>I don't smell it.</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>That must be from New York that's stuck in your nose or something.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Come on. It really did smell.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>But the thing no one can deny is that underneath our feet, there's a web of coal mines that stretches for miles.</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>40 miles in each direction, 30 miles.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Somewhere in those mines is a fire that's been burning for 40 years and has either destroyed this town...</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Or not.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Depending on who you ask. This is Pat right here.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>My name is Mary Lou [Gone 00:44:34]. I'm 82 years old and I lived in Centralia most of my adult life.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>What year were you born in, if you mind me asking?</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>What year was I born?</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>1927.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou Gone grew up in a town not too far from Centralia.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Tiny little farm town called Burnsville.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>When she got to Centralia, she said...</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>It was like moving to the city. It had a legion, had a truck store, it had...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Couple thousand people.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Lots of bar rooms in Centralia. Somebody told me one time there were 22 bar rooms in Centralia. I don't know if that was true because I didn't frequent bar rooms at that age.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And all these places that she just mentioned were right on top of each other.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>So, when you were walking around, you'd see people all the time.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Just take for instance you go to the post office after work-</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>I'll show you where the post office was.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Tom would be there sometimes.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>I was post master here for a number of years.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>You're pointing at a forest.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>It's hard to imagine this stuff.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>It is hard to imagine.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, I walked in the post office because your mail wasn't delivered. So, I'd go up to the post office, I'd get my mail, and you'd meet people in the post office, you'd meet people coming out of the post office.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>This was a good football field here, now it's all growing in, nobody's cutting the grass, there's bushes growing up in it now.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Tom Dempsey would have a story. I would be an hour until I got home. A whole hour. This is how Centralia was.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Okay, fast forward. It's Memorial Day 1962.</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>This is where the bar used to dump all their garbage. Now, the fire started, I'd say just about right here where I'm standing right now.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Tommy points to a little patch of non-descript yellow grass.</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>Right here.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>How did it start? Do we have any idea?</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>Well, it started-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>The most likely scenario, he says, we also heard this from a writer named Joan Quigley.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>I'm the writer of The Day The Earth Caved In.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Is that people used to heat their homes with coal and maybe somebody threw their ashes into the garbage which then ended up onto the dump.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>It caught the whole thing on fire.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Furniture, rugs, kerosene cans.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Which Joan says wasn't that unusual.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Some of the former fire fighters said the dumps caught on fire all the time.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And usually the fires just fizzled out on their own, but this one, for whatever reason, before it did, wandered a little bit.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>It found its way over to an old exposed...</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>Exposed [coal vein 00:46:41] there.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Basically an old strip mine that should've been covered but wasn't.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>So, there was just a big, open cavity.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>When the fire got in there and-</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>Hit that coal vein.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Poof.</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>Fire trucks came up here and they hosed down the fire until they thought it was out and they left. Following day, somebody says, \"Oh, we see smoke and steam coming out of the ground up there.\" So, they came back the next day and they tried to get the fire out and they couldn't very well do it. They weren't getting it.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Because at that point, it was too late.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>I wouldn't know where to start with this mine fire. I wouldn't know where to start.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>The first place that fire camped out was right underneath Mary Lou's house.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>I have some [crosstalk 00:47:16].</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>And from that point on, it kind of took over her life.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>My goodness, are these your scrapbooks? When we were there, she pulled out these two-</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Gigantic scrapbooks. This is going to take four men to lift this book.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Each book is literally three feet tall and they document in painful detail how that fire split the town in two.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>This is how intense I was with this mine fire.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>She heaved open the book and she showed us this picture of three people crouched on the street in front of a hole.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>This is my husband, my son, and me.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Husband holding a thermometer.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>We dropped this down on a fishing pole, down on a-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Oh, like you're ice fishing.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This was their way of measuring the temperature of the fire below. What did it read?</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>It was pretty high.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>100 degrees high.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>850, something like that.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>What? Under your house?</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>No, this was on the street.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>But the street right in front of her house.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Oh, wow.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>The garage was right... As you can see, the garage here, it was right there.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>She showed us another picture of her standing in her garage in front of a trench that they dug and inside that trench, you see flames.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Oh, we used to go out at night and watch the glowing and the embers.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Fire up there got so bad that some of Mary Lou's neighbors actually got government money to leave their houses.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>They were the first people bought out.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Never once at the beginning did you think, \"Oh, maybe we should just get out of here\"?</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>No.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>There's a fire under. Never?</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>No. I never [inaudible 00:48:36], no.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Instead, she did exactly the opposite.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>This was my husband and this was a big official and this was-</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>She dug in her heels and started writing letters.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Congressmen Mulligan, Musto, we wrote letters to him. We talked on the phone with him. I couldn't tell you all the congressmen we talked to. Four governors, all the Harrisburg officials and they were promising everything but the sun, but it never happened.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>But other than the people who lived on that street, many, many people in town didn't have to worry or even think about the mine fire.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Nobody ever believed that the fire was even serious in Centralia. My husband, myself, and [inaudible 00:49:10].</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Oh, so everyone else was kind of [crosstalk 00:49:13].</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>It's uptown. The fire's uptown.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>All that changed on Valentine's Day 1981.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>We're up a little bit higher.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Because of this guy.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>A fella named Tom Demboski, who at the time was just a boy.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>I was 12.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>12 year old boy.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>He's playing outside.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>In his grandmother's backyard.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>I noticed some small whisps of smoke coming out of the ground.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>So, he went over to take a look.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>As I bent down to investigate, I noticed that my feet were starting to sink in. It was really soft.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>It was like quicksand.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>The more I tried to struggle, the more I was just opening the hole larger.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>He wound up sliding.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>To my thighs, to my waist.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Until he was...</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>I was under.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>All the way underground, surrounded by hot steam.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>The smoke was so intense.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Smells like rotten eggs.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Whoa.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>I was screaming for my cousin.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>And his cousin heard him and came running over.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>Plucked me out like a flower.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>What happened to him changed everything.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Because suddenly, reporters were everything.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>Reporters from the Evening Herald.</p>\r\n<p>News Reporter:</p>\r\n<p>This is Night Line.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>National news media.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Everybody pointing their cameras at Todd.</p>\r\n<p>Todd D.:</p>\r\n<p>I seen smoke, so I went over to see if it was the mine fire and when I did, I just fell right through.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And doing stories about this town that was on fire.</p>\r\n<p>News Reporter:</p>\r\n<p>Beneath Centralia, the underground coal fires still burn hot.</p>\r\n<p>News Reporter:</p>\r\n<p>Centralia is an inferno. Literally.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>That attention-</p>\r\n<p>News Reporter:</p>\r\n<p>Parts of Centralia look like the outskirts of hell.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>... would focus-</p>\r\n<p>News Reporter:</p>\r\n<p>Toxic fumes.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>... on what had to happen for the town.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>It wasn't long, says Joan, before some of the other residents-</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Very small, informal group of young parents.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>... organized a march.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Down Locust Avenue, down the main street in town.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>How many people are we talking about here?</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Couple dozen with red ribbons around their arms and their wrists. They walked two by two down the main street of Centralia like striking miners.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou glared at them as they passed.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>I was bitter. I was bitter. They claimed they were for helping the town to be saved, but they weren't.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>What they were really for, she figured, was getting out.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>They were looking for funds to get relocated.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>She even hated their name.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Concerned Citizens Against the Centralia Mine Fire.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>She thought, how are they the concerned citizens? She's the concerned citizen. She had been fighting the fire for years.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>The media was there taking video.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Cameras filmed the marchers looping red ribbon over everything and Mary Lou's neighbor Helen...</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Cut the red ribbons down.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Because we fought so hard to try to save Centralia. Why did they want to do this?</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>People like Mary Lou and Helen Wilmer...</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>They started telling people...</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>\"No, no, no. Here's why it's safe. Here's why you should stay.\"</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>While parents from the other group were on TV complaining about gases...</p>\r\n<p>Parent:</p>\r\n<p>It's in the home and it could be a death house.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou, Helen and a few others started up their own committee.</p>\r\n<p>News Reporter:</p>\r\n<p>The United Centralia Area Mine Task Force.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>They got on TV themselves and in the community, they started printing out fliers.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Fact sheets.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>And handing them out.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Yep, door-to-door.</p>\r\n<p>David Lam:</p>\r\n<p>Okay, I call this meeting to order.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>At town meetings, the dueling committees would get up there and make their case.</p>\r\n<p>Parent:</p>\r\n<p>But this is a-</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Get yelled down.</p>\r\n<p>Parent:</p>\r\n<p>... will not protect us!</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Would it get-</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Get rowdy.</p>\r\n<p>Parent:</p>\r\n<p>Absolutely ridiculous.</p>\r\n<p>David Lam:</p>\r\n<p>Families fighting against families, neighbors against neighbors.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>There's Lammy.</p>\r\n<p>David Lam:</p>\r\n<p>They split the town apart.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Who's that?</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>David Lam.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This guy David Lam ran a motorcycle shop in town and he was also a member of this concerned citizens organization. One morning, about 4:00 AM...</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>He was sleeping in an apartment and someone threw a Molotov cocktail through his plate glass window.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou showed us an article from scrapbook. It was related to Lam's activities as an officer of Concerned Citizens. Wow. This is no joke. This is like the Sopranos, but worse.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>This was really... It was really bad.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>In the midst of all this chaos, Congress started considering a bill that would basically let them buy out the town.</p>\r\n<p>News Reporter:</p>\r\n<p>Some observers believe that for about $50 million, Centralia could be totally bought out.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Until the mayor decided, let's hold a referendum.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>And the issue was stay or go.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>In the weeks leading up to the referendum, Mary Lou and Helen again went door to door talking to people they'd known their whole lives and pretty much everyone they talked to said...</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>I really want to stay. My mother wants to stay.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>August 11th, 1983.</p>\r\n<p>News Reporter:</p>\r\n<p>Shortly before 10:00 this evening, Centralia's mayor announced the results.</p>\r\n<p>Mayor:</p>\r\n<p>There's 545 votes cast. 200 voted to stay, 345 voted to relocate.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>I was crying, yes. In my heart, I never thought that would happen ever.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>You thought that everybody would stay.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>We would stay. Maybe 40 people might decide or maybe 30 but that was devastating to know that so many people wanted to move. It was.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>When you look at her scrapbooks, everything stops after that day.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah, this is just thrown in papers.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Wow, it just stopped so abruptly.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Yep. I was mad and disgusted. I didn't want to do no more about it. That was the end.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Almost immediately after that vote, Congress bought out the town, people started packing up and leaving.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Let me see where it is. I have some that has the big numbers on it.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou told us that when you decided to leave, a demolition crew would actually come to your house and paint...</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Red letters like this.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>A big number one in front of your house.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>It looked like blood was dripping off.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Oh, it's like you were marked.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>What would happen, she says, when your house was marked is that your neighbors would see it, they'd get nervous, then suddenly their houses would be marked. Then suddenly the whole block would be marked.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>I know everyone quite well and I think I stopped talking to some of them.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>She'd see them on the street, she says, and look the other way.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>I didn't like any of them.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Really?</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Then one day in the fall of 1987, these divisions caused something to happen that is just kind of mythically bad.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>It involved a married couple who'd been in the town. Well, she'd been there her whole life.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>As a couple, they were divided. One wanted to stay, one wanted to go. I think it was the wife who didn't want to leave.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>The husband, he was a shovel runner and he wanted to take the money you get from relocation and get out.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>Their neighbors were moving, had moved. The houses around them were being torn down and they had to make a decision.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>All we really know is that at some point, they started to argue and it escalated.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>He stabbed her to death with a kitchen knife and then drove up to an old stripping pit and set himself and his car on fire.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Wow. This is going to sound like a strange question but is there anything about that that makes sense to you? Why couldn't people let go of this place?</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>It is very primal.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Beyond that, she really couldn't say why. We asked Mary Lou, who hung on long after the murder, after that referendum, after the town was basically empty.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>I have no idea what kept me there. I have no idea.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>You have no idea?</p>\r\n<p>Mary Lou:</p>\r\n<p>Uh-uh (negative). No idea. I just didn't want to move.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>[crosstalk 00:56:18] Yeah. Today, 11 people live in town.</p>\r\n<p>Tom:</p>\r\n<p>His brother and his wife and...</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>My mom and them live down in the intersection.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Tom and Tom pointed them all out from the hill. We knocked on every door, figured we'd ask them what it is that keeps them living literally on top of a fire. Hi, good evening. Wow. That was the shortest...</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>But none of them wanted to talk to us.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Not even the dogs. Hi. Whoa! Okay, [inaudible 00:56:46], all right. But then Tom 2 took us to one last spot.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Where are we right now?</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>We're in Saint Ignatius Roman Catholic Cemetery.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This cemetery is just a few feet away from the hill where we started and it's a really strange contrast. You go from this steamy hell and then suddenly you're in woodsy Vermont.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>There's a lot of people.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>It's beautiful.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>This is my grandfather and my grandmother.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Tom has four generations buried here.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Do you know how many people are here, Tom?</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>There's over 3000 burials in this cemetery alone.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>3000?</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>Yes. Plus.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>The thing is, says Tom, even the people that left, fled that fire continue to come back and be buried in this cemetery which means this place, this cemetery is the only thing in Centralia that's still growing. Suddenly, how Joan put it earlier...</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>It is very primal.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Made sense.</p>\r\n<p>Joan Quigley:</p>\r\n<p>You can experience your life on a multigenerational plane.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>This is where my great grandparents are buried.</p>\r\n<p>Pat Walters:</p>\r\n<p>Which means, in a sense, this town will never die as long as the cemetery's still here.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>[crosstalk 00:58:00] read their name on here.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>This year?</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>Dig it out.</p>\r\n<p>Jad Abumrad:</p>\r\n<p>Oh, it's under the dirt.</p>\r\n<p>Tom D.:</p>\r\n<p>[inaudible 00:58:11] Get this up out of here somehow.

Then, we dive into a molecular detective story to pinpoint the beginning of the AIDS, and we re-imagine the moment the virus that caused the global pandemic sprang to life. After that, we're left wondering if you can trace the spread of an idea the way you can trace the spread of a disease. In the end, we find ourselves faced with a choice between competing claims about the origin of the high five.

Like that&rsquo;s what we want as storytellers. So in some sense your scenario 3 is like - the death of story in some sense, it&rsquo;s the anti story.</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>MUSIC OUT</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>JH: Feels less glamorous doesn&rsquo;t it.</p>\r\n<p>JA: Well yeah it it</p>\r\n<p>JH: But you know what?</p>\r\n<p>JA: runs counter.</p>\r\n<p>JH: Do you know what when Darwin came up with the theory of - well when he published his theory of evolution by natural selection - that felt</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>#01:13:30.77#</p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p>like a death in a way. Cause it felt like you were taking away the creator - this amazing being. Uh - you were diminishing life to - sort of mindless process. So a lot of people criti- criticized him for the same thing. It&rsquo;s not as romantic. It&rsquo;s not as - well - it is as awesome.
