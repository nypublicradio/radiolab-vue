They’re sort of the world’s worst consolation prize for loss. But last year, we began wondering… Where did these stages come from in the first place?</span></p>\n<p><span>Turns out, </span><span>Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. But the story is much, </span><em><span>much</span></em><span> more complicated than that. T</span><span>hose stages of grieving? They actually started as stages of dying. After learning that, producer Rachael Cusick tumbled into a year-long journey through the life and work of the incredibly complicated and misunderstood woman who single-handedly changed the way all of us face dying, and the way we deal with being left behind.</span></p>\n<p><span>Special Note: Our friends over at Death Sex and Money have put together a very special companion to this story, featuring Rachael talking about this story with her grandmother.

This is Radiolab. And today we have the story of a journey, you could call it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah. Sort of The Journey, really.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Because it's&mdash;it's The Journey because it's all of our journeys. It's a journey we're all on at some point.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yes. And the person who is gonna take us on this journey today&mdash;you're on your own after this&mdash;but today is our very own producer Rachael Cusick.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL CUSICK:</strong><span> So back in the early-2000s when I was five years old, my favorite thing on TV was this infomercial.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, infomercial: </em></strong><em><span>Are you ready for the wildest paint set you've ever seen? It's the amazing Rainbow Art Set! Painting has never been this easy, or ...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>For The Rainbow Art Set.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, infomercial: </em></strong><em><span>Create amazing drawings and works of art instantly!]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Whenever that commercial came on, I lost my shit.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, infomercial: </em></strong><em><span>Now that's magic! As easy as 1-2-3. Simply dip, dab and draw.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>It was this little foam brush that you could swipe across these six wheels of colors, stacked like Oreos, and then you could paint rainbow dragonflies and rainbow bicycles and rainbow palm trees. And amazingly ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, infomercial: </em></strong><em><span>With Rainbow Art, look! No splatter, no drips, and the colors dry instantly. Amazing!]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>The colors never bled into each other. I begged for that art kit for months. And eventually for my birthday, I got one. I remember painting with that thing for hours, twirling the foam brush across a blank page into circles and butterflies and butterflies made of circles, each swipe this perfect little tidy rainbow of colors.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And those pictures, they were cards, really. I would tape them to the bed frame where my mom slept while she recovered from chemo, while she was put in hospice, and when she eventually died when I was six. After she died, I don't remember seeing her body, I don't remember crying, I don't remember any of the eulogies, and I don't remember what we had for dinner that first night that her seat at the table was officially empty. But I do know that we weren't supposed to talk about the sadness of that empty chair.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And during those years, I really remember sitting at our dinner table, looking around at my older siblings and the grown-ups in our lives, and they just looked so normal. And I know it didn't feel normal to them and it wasn't this simple. But to me, as this, like, little sister looking up to everybody, it looked like they had figured out how to handle this thing that had happened to us. And I&mdash;I tried to act normal too, but this mess inside me would just snowball. Like, I would sneak cookies in my pockets and binge eat them until it hurt. And I would slam doors and burst into tears so easily. It just felt like I spent my childhood fighting off these feelings and failing, and fighting and failing, and thinking there must be something wrong with me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>But then one day when I was older, in my late teens I think, I finally found what I thought was a way out.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Grief often comes in five stages.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>I'm not sure when or how exactly I came across it, but ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>You're gonna go through what we call the five stages of grief.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Five stages of grief.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>It was this five-part checklist.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>There are five stages of grief.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>What are you talking about?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>You might have heard of these stages. The idea is pretty simple. It's basically that in the wake of losing a loved one, you'll go through a series of feelings. First ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Stage one ...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Denial.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Denial.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Denial.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Then stage two.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Step two, that's anger.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Anger.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Then bargaining.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Bargaining.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Okay.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>After that is ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Depression.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Depression. And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Finally, acceptance.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>... last but not least, acceptance. I think when I first came across the stages, they were really like the first time I had heard this word \"grief&rdquo; kind of underlined as, like, this thing to go through. Like, oh! Maybe that door slamming the other week, maybe that was the anger stage. And finally, those things were okay to feel. Like, they were these designated stops on a bus to acceptance. And so I just let myself be angry and then I'd be depressed. But anger always came back, and the feelings, they just kept coming at the wrong times and repeating. And I felt like I should have been over this. Like, it was exhausting, and it felt like when it came to grief, I just couldn't do anything right. The stages, they became these, like, supermodel tight jean versions of quote-unquote \"normal\" grieving that I couldn't fit into. And I was finally just like, \"Fuck this.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Like, who the hell sold me this crock of shit?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>[laughs] Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And I remember, like, the night I felt like I was, like, interrogating Google. I was like, \"Who gave me the stages?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Like, \"I want to&mdash;I want to strangle them!\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>I&mdash;yeah. And so then I went over&mdash;one thing I do a lot when I, like, find something or someone that, like, I don't like is I go to Google Images.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>In my head, I'm picturing, like, this slicked-back, sleazy car salesman with, like, a grinning smile and, like, a self help-y Dracula-caped monster. But when I googled the stages of grief, the first image I see is, this woman who's like&mdash;has this old, gray wispy hair and is wearing, like, this purple button-down shirt that's like the color of Barney the Dinosaur. And she's crouched in a pile of daisies. And I'm like, \"This? Like, this is the lady?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs] And you were like, \"Wait!\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>I was like, I kind of want to borrow that shirt. Like, I was feeling so complicated. I remember staring at it for a few minutes, just thinking, \"Who is she?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>So the daisy lady, her name was Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Oh! I've&mdash;I've heard that name before. Maybe?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>I hadn't, but at a certain point in time, she was pretty famous. And actually, the thing that made her famous is not studying how people grieve, it was studying how people die.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Huh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And I was like, \"Okay, I'm curious.\" And so I started digging around. Problem is, there's endless crap about the stages, but not really any one place where you can go to learn about Elisabeth and her story. So I ended up on this very odd journey that's taken over my life for the past year. I spend my days and nights just digging through archives, reading and listening to whatever interviews or talks with her I could find, and calling up anyone I thought might have anything to tell me about her. And what I was eventually able to piece together was a story of this incredibly complicated woman who single-handedly changed the way we all face dying. And the way that we all deal with being left behind.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Well, all right!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yes.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Okay, okay. [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Take us on the journey.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Take&mdash;yeah, let's go. Let's do it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Okay, so Elisabeth died back in 2004, but I called the photographer of that daisy photo</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN ROSS: </em></strong><em><span>Hi, my name's Ken Ross. I'm the son of Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross, and I'm also the president of the Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross Foundation.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>Growing up, like, did everybody know her, and then you're like, \"Gosh, my mom's famous for dying, and I just want to blend in like a normal teenager?\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN ROSS: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, yeah, totally. It was just hugely embarrassing when she's on the cover of People Magazine, or especially when she was on the cover of Playboy. You know, things ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>She was on the cover of Playboy?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN ROSS: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah. I mean not obviously, you know, her picture.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>Not a centerfold. [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>So let me back up a little bit and tell you how Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross became the face of dying. She was born in Switzerland.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN ROSS: </em></strong><em><span>In Zurich.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>In 1926.

Death was everywhere, and now here was this woman who really for the first time ever was helping us look directly at this thing that was happening all around us.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Soon, Elisabeth starts putting these interviews and her thoughts about them down on paper.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN ROSS: </em></strong><em><span>After about 10:00, 10:30 at night the clicking would start.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>[laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN ROSS: </em></strong><em><span>And she was typing with two fingers.

She was like the fucking Rolling Stones, man. Like, people rolled out the carpets for her.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs] I'm imagining all of these&mdash;these young kids in the streets just going ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>\"Aaaaaah!\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Like&mdash;like the Beatles.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>\"Elisabeth!

He's the founding father of palliative care in Canada. And he actually got into that work because he went to go see Elisabeth speak at one of those early lectures.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BALFOUR MOUNT: </em></strong><em><span>She was remarkable.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Even though it was like a rock hall on the outside, on the inside of the seminars, things were intimate.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross: </em></strong><em><span>I think it did bother her.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>She wouldn't stand behind the podium.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BALFOUR MOUNT: </em></strong><em><span>She chose to sit on the lecture table, swinging her legs back and forth.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>She would just talk.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross: </em></strong><em><span>The horrible question that we're all afraid of, and that never happens, that the patient looks at you and says, \"Am I going to die?\"]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BALFOUR MOUNT: </em></strong><em><span>But when she started speaking in that little soft voice, she could have an audience in the palm of her hand for the next 45 minutes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN ROSS: </em></strong><em><span>I mean, there was not a sound in the audience.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BALFOUR MOUNT: </em></strong><em><span>She just had them.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Like, I didn't think it was possible to see a twinkle in someone's eyes from, like, fuzzy, YouTube archival videos, but when she speaks about this, you just see this superpower in her.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross: </em></strong><em><span>And how do you react to the nasty, unpleasant, mean patient?

And on top of that, there was this prescriptive order that never worked for me. But the thing is, when Elisabeth created these things, they were stages a dying person would go through, not a grieving person like me. And they weren't even as tidy and orderly as the world made them out to be. If you actually go back and read Elisabeth's book ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>\"On Death and Dying.'

It was for my mom. And, like, she never let herself feel those things. I think it was just because she was trying to fight it for so long and be there for us. And, like, death wasn't an option for her. But it was&mdash;it was the only thing. And so when she&mdash;when she died, I don't know, for me at least, I felt like I had to stay strong for her. But then here was Elisabeth in some way kind of talking to both of us and saying, like, \"It could have gone differently.\" And I guess because of that, I just started building this little pedestal for her. And, like, every day I was shining it and, like, putting flowers on it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>But then as I kept digging into her story, all that changed.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>We'll get to all of that in a moment.

After a short break.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And just shortly before that short break, Rachael hooked up with friends at the podcast Death, Sex and Money. And not just Rachael. Rachael and her grandmother, her mother's mother. And so when you get to the end of this episode and you are gonna want to hear more from Rachael, I promise you. That's where you can go to hear her talk about more of this stuff. We'll give you more details about that at the end of the show.

But when I learned about the next part of her life, there was kind of this pile up of things that happened all together that just made me feel differently about her and what she could teach me. And it all started with this thing.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS KLASS: </em></strong><em><span>Elisabeth&mdash;Elisabeth had some other realities.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Elisabeth's former assistant, Dennis Klass told me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS KLASS: </em></strong><em><span>Did you read about Mrs. Schwartz?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>No, who's that?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS KLASS: </em></strong><em><span>Well, I did not recruit Mrs. Schwartz for the seminar, but somebody did.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Dennis said Mrs. Schwartz was one of Elisabeth's patients. But then one day ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS KLASS: </em></strong><em><span>Mrs. Schwartz appeared to her in the hallway by her office and said something about, \"You are called to this. Keep it going.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>The only problem is ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS KLASS: </em></strong><em><span>Mrs. Schwartz is dead.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[gasps]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS KLASS: </em></strong><em><span>And Elisabeth asked for&mdash;she said, \"Would you write this down so that I can show people you were really here?\" And Mrs. Schwartz wrote it down and she signed \"Mrs. Schwartz.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Was it one of those, like, where you write a letter knowing it's gonna to be delivered after your death? Or did she ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>No. No, Elisabeth told Dennis that she had received a letter from a dead lady. And Elisabeth's son Ken said it wasn't a one time kind of deal. Like, around this time, Elisabeth started talking about these things that she called \"her spooks.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN ROSS: </em></strong><em><span>You know, that word I think in particular really set off the media. Elisabeth is talking about her spooks.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Other dead people like Mrs. Schwartz, but with names like Mario and Willie.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN ROSS: </em></strong><em><span>The only one I remember her mention by name was Joseph.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah that's kind of bizarre.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Yeah. It's a little bit funny, but it also was a turn that ended up taking her to a very dark place.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>Hello?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>Hello?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>I'm just gonna let these two guys tell it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>Don Schumacher.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>And Tom Frantz? Or France?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>Frantz. I was a faculty member at the University of Buffalo.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>My most recent job was as the president of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Both these guys spent their lives working in dying and grief. And they both got into this work because of Elisabeth.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>It really changed my career dramatically, meeting her.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, absolutely.

But after that, she bought some land out in Southern California so she could start a healing center. She called it ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Shanti Nilaya ...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Which means \"Final Home of Peace.\" And I've heard from numerous people, the center, it kind of looks like a motel. But the idea was people could come and take workshops with her to talk about dying and grieving. So in 1977, Don and Tom took a visit to Shanti Nilaya.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>This was a little&mdash;well, a very far-out experience.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>But it was not at all anything that I thought it was going to be.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>So Tom and Don, they go with Elisabeth into this room.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>Very large room like a&mdash;like a cafeteria room.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>With a couple dozen other people there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>So we all sat in chairs around the edge.

We sang the hell out of it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Then Tom said through the dark, in the middle of the room, he saw these scarves ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>Scarves, they would light up.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>... shimmying and dancing around.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>Two or three of them in different colors.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And then ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>We were told that we would be approached by our spirit guide.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>An entity ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>Our soulmate in this experience.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>... would take human form and be created and speak to you.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>A moment later, Don says ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>Your spirit guide approached you.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>It was pitch black.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>But Tom says he could tell that a person, like an actual person, was standing there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>A human being seemed to be there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And that spirit guide would lead them into another room.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM FRANTZ: </em></strong><em><span>Like a closet, because it was very small, and they needed it to be isolated and free of all other human contact during this time, we were told.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>And they would talk to you about your past lives.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>Who was your spirit guide, do you remember?

And in this room they just ended up having this weird uncomfortable encounter that they didn't really even understand.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>So it was hard. It was hard to go through.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And it got worse. Like, fairly soon after Elisabeth opened Shanti Nilaya, the man who ran these dark room sessions, this guy named Jay Barham, was accused by numerous people of engaging in sexual misconduct in these dark rooms.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Oh, no!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Yeah. And Elisabeth protected this guy. Saying like, \"He couldn't possibly have done this, he's one of the most gifted healers I know.\" And she said that for over a year before she eventually fired him.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>And everybody was shocked and dismayed, I think, when we got out of there that we had been taken advantage of.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>Did you have to pay to go?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>I don't think so, but I don't recall.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>So when you say 'taken advantage of,' it's more like emotionally and psychologically not, like, financially.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DON SCHUMACHER: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah. Oh, yeah. And more than that, that Elisabeth was being taken advantage of.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>A lot of people I talked to about this said that they don't think Elisabeth really knew what was going on, that she was manipulated by Jay just like everybody else. But I don't know. Like, I have a really hard time figuring out how to feel about this. And so did a lot of people. Like, her husband divorced her. And at this point, Elisabeth left California and ran away to this small town in Virginia to get another center off the ground, but the locals there did not want her there. People protested, they sent her death threats, someone killed her pet llama.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh, damn!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And then eventually, her house mysteriously burnt to the ground. She and Ken both suspected arson. And after that, she ended up having a series of strokes, so again she moved back across the country to Arizona. And at this point, she kind of fell off the map for years until she herself started dying.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Oprah Winfrey:</em></strong><em><span> Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross.

But when you walk into the world, and all you're left with is a silhouette of what happened to you and also to the person you love, you don't have a bridge to living in a world without them. And in the end, in both her life and death, Elisabeth really showed all of us the power of a rich human messy, maybe ugly but also beautiful picture of death.

Because they were out and they were having fun and they were laughing and I just [sniffles]&mdash;sorry.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>Don't apologize.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM RILEY: </em></strong><em><span>I had a&mdash;like, a flash forward to seeing them doing that, you know, a year from now, two years from now, whatever. And it just made me feel great and that made me feel sad. And that was easy to understand because that was&mdash;they're gonna do great, and you're not going to be able to see it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Tom died a couple months after that conversation, and just weeks before this story was supposed to come out. And those conversations we had, I miss them all the time. But I think I treasure them more than anything else. Like, talking to him, it felt like letting out this breath I'd been holding my whole life.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And this thing Elisabeth tried to show us, I finally understood, and in a visceral way. There isn't a simple way out of grief. What there is is people. Sitting with them, listening to them while they're still here, for as long as you can.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>So far, I have been thinking a lot about, like, oh my gosh, what is it gonna be like the day that I call and you don't pick up? Like, that I think about a lot. But I don't really have any dread or fear. It's kind of just like a question.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TOM RILEY: </em></strong><em><span>No, I think about&mdash;I think about you sometimes. I'm glad we met.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>I am too, Tom.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>I am so grateful to the many&mdash;and I mean many&mdash;people who helped me put this story together. Like, so many I can't actually fit them all here. But their names are on our website. Go check that out. And I just want to send an extra special thank you to Martha Twaddle who connected me with Tom. Carin Leong, who made all of my montage dreams come true for this episode. And to Soren Wheeler for telling me to look up that lady who created those damn stages of grief. And Pat Walters who received more middle-of-the-night Elisabeth fangirl updates than any human being should have to endure.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And of course, thanks to you, Rachael Cusick.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Who we should say, like, single-handedly reported and produced this piece. As I mentioned before the break, you probably want to hear more from Rachael right now, and to be able to do that you can go to the podcast Death, Sex &amp; Money. They released an episode today where you can hear Rachael talking with her grandmother.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>I always wondered what it was like for me to be working on this story while you were sick. I don't know if you have any thoughts about it. Like, I remember one day the nurse came to your house and I had the On Death and Dying book. And she gave me this look like \"Holy shit, you're really just out there doing it, aren't you?\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRANDMA: </em></strong><em><span>[laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>And I wonder, like, what you feel about it. Is it weird? Is it comforting? What does that feel like for you?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRANDMA: </em></strong><em><span>No I don't&mdash;I thought it was something you needed to do. I just thought this was your way of, you know, of dealing with this. And that's a smart way, that's an intelligent way to delve into it and see what it's all about. So I just thought that was a comfort to you, perhaps. And that however it worked out, it would be&mdash;it would be okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Go check it out. Just search for Death, Sex &amp; Money wherever you get your podcasts. What's it called, Rachael?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>It's called, \"When Grief Doesn't Move in Stages.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I'm Latif Nasser.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I'm Jad Abumrad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Thank you for listening.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>LISTENER:</em></strong><em><span> Radiolab was created by Jad Abumrad and is edited by Soren Wheeler.

But first, we wanted to tell you about something new and shiny.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong> Yeah. Which is a new and shiny delivery mechanism for our&mdash;for this show that we love so much, which is you can get it on YouTube now.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>Yeah. So Radiolab has recently made this whole massive YouTube channel, which has some kind of amazing things from over the years. It has animated shorts, it's got music videos from collaborations we've done with different musicians.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong> It's got live shows. It's got&mdash;yeah, it's got a ton of stuff. But the best thing of all, I think, is it has these, like, bundles. It has these&mdash;these themed lists, including a sort of a starter kit. So for people who are maybe more recent to the show, like, you can just quickly just race, gallop through all our favorite episodes. That's YouTube.com/RadiolabPod.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>So as we were putting that together, thinking about, you know, what are the really special Radiolabs, we started thinking about this oldie but a goodie, which is called \"Animal Minds.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong> Are you in this? I heard a voice.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>I am. This is like baby reporter me. This is one of my favorite assignments of all time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong> Don't spoil the top, though. But it's so good.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>I won't. But I was just starting out and they said, \"Hey, can you go record this almost surreal sounding event,\" which I didn't quite believe took place. And that's how it kicks off.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong> Don't spoil it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>Okay, I won't say anymore. Let's just&mdash;there's a good tussle ahead, and yeah, let's just let the&mdash;the Radiolabbers of the past take us away.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT KRULWICH:</strong> So where are we?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD ABUMRAD:</strong> We're at church.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>In a church. Oh, that's&mdash;that's different for us.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah. It's not usually where we start, we're in a church.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Mm-hmm.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Cathedral really. A huge cathedral in upper Manhattan, St. John the Divine. We've got an organ.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>That's the preacher, there's the preacher.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Congregation of course.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Mm-hmm. A couple thousand people in the pews at least. It's your basic Sunday service. Except today. You've also got&mdash;here it comes!</p>\r\n<p>[dog barking]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Dogs! The reason we begin here is because today the church is filled with dogs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>Can I talk to you about your dog?</p>\r\n<p><strong>MAN:</strong> Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>What's his or her name?</p>\r\n<p><strong>MAN:</strong> His name is Blozer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>And what is he?</p>\r\n<p><strong>MAN:</strong> He's a Labrador and poodle mix.</p>\r\n<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Well, I have Legend, who I just adopted in January.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>Okay.</p>\r\n<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> I have Denzel.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Oh, by the way, you have more than dogs, you've got birds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GIRL:</strong> His name is Jessie. It's a barn owl.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>And now has this guy ever been blessed before?</p>\r\n<p><strong>GIRL:</strong> I don't think so. No. He was just born this year.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And hamsters.</p>\r\n<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> His name is Tubby. Tubby Toes, and if he'd come out you'd see why, it's because he's really fat.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And all kinds of creatures.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>We've got a little girl with a falcon. And behind her, oh, it's a giant tortoise!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>This is the St. Francis day of the animals. It's a yearly event.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>And coming towards us...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Where people bring their animals to be blessed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>...is a donkey.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>The folks that are gathered here...</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>And there's a little girl with a hermit crab.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>...they don't think there's anything weird or inappropriate about this. In fact, if you ask them...</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>And here comes a bull!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>...here's what they say.</p>\r\n<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> I don't know if it means anything to her but it means it to me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Because you know you want it to baptize your babies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> And this is more or less the same kind of thing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>And what is it&mdash;what does it mean to you?</p>\r\n<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> It just means when, when she finally does go away she's gonna go to heaven.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>And what kind of parrot is she?</p>\r\n<p><strong>MAN:</strong> A macaw, blue and gold. Oh yeah, don't put your hand near his face.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>And what's his name?</p>\r\n<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Chuckles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>Chuckles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PARROT:</strong> Bye bye.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong>Do you feel like he has a soul, or an inner life of some sort?</p>\r\n<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> It's a thinking being. They're as smart as we are, really.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Jad?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Since you invited me here I don't want to be impolite or anything.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Say what you're gonna say!</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Well, okay. These people of course they love their animals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Sure. Yeah, you can hear that.</p>\r\n<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> Because when I'm feeling sad he comes in the bed, and he lays down spine to spine with me, and he just doesn't leave my side.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But aren't they presuming a little bit, that the animals they love are going to feel the grace of the prayer, or feel the blessing, which is a...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Which raises a question.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>What do we really know about what goes on inside the animal's mind?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah, all those things you might feel in a church: grace, gratitude, guilt. Can the animals feel those things too?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>How much can we share?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And can you measure it?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>I'm Jad Abumrad.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>I'm Robert Krulwich.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>This is Radiolab.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And we'll begin the hour with a story about an animal who would I'm sure loved to have been at the worship service but was&mdash;it was a very inconvenient thing for him.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>He didn't get the info.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>He couldn't quite get there.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Okay just to get things rolling. This is a story that we heard about...</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>It's okay, I give them enough to talk about as it is.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>...first from the following dude.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Hey, is it Mick or is it Mike?</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>I go by Mick. There's way too many Mikes around.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs] Oh, okay.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Mick Menago is his name.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>Well the boat's down here...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And we met Mick recently at the Emeryville Marina, which is not far from San Francisco, where he's got a boat called the Super Fish that Mick says he rents out for all kinds of things.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>Nature trips to ash scattering, bachelor parties, fireworks watching. I don't care. I got a little cardboard sign, I stand by the freeway it says \"Have boat, need work.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>So yeah, that's Mick. And our story begins one morning in December.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>Probably eight o'clock in the morning or something as I recall.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>This is a few years back. Mick, he's just kind of sitting at home.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>I was at home, yeah. It was the middle of December. We didn't have any work.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But then he gets this call.</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Mick Menago: </strong>Hello?]</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>I got this call.</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Mick Menago: </strong>Hello there.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>It was a call relaying a message from a fisherman way out at sea.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>Eighteen miles maybe outside the Golden Gate Bridge. They told me that there was a whale in trouble, tangled up in crab gear, and it didn't appear to be able to move.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>So after he hangs up Mick immediately calls a few dive buddies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>Tim Young.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Tim Young, Air Force Pararescue.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>And then let's see.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> James Moskito.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>James Moskito.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> Professional diver.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>I called him and said \"Hey, you know, here's the deal. Are you interested?\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> It was a no brainer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> I said \"Yeah, I'm in absolutely.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>I figured all right we're going.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> So I packed up my stuff.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Grabbed my gear, and I went directly to the boat.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOLLY DREWYARD:</strong> And we left underneath the Golden Gate Bridge. Nothing but the horizon in front of us. My name is Holly Drewyard. I am James' significant other. [laughs] We motored out for about two hours. Headed due west towards the Farallon Islands.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ELLEN HORNE:</strong> What were you feeling when you were on the boat heading out?</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOLLY DREWYARD:</strong> I didn't think we'd find her. I really didn't.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But at 18 miles off the coast, completely open water, one of the divers spots some crab buoys in the distance, and some seagulls flying overhead. And as they got closer...</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOLLY DREWYARD:</strong> Well, I saw the whale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> It was just a...</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOLLY DREWYARD:</strong> Just the very top of the whale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Sticking up about maybe six inches out of the water.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOLLY DREWYARD:</strong> At the surface.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>A tiny sliver of black.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> And that was it. And then I said \"Okay, we need to see what's going on, so...\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>So Tim and James jump into an inflatable boat, and they paddle about a couple of hundred feet from the whale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> And it just wasn't happening. Every time that this whale came on up it would just displace the boat back again, so it would push us back again.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Not to mention...</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> The visibility in the water was just terrible.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>They couldn't even see down there to see, you know, what they were dealing with.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> And you know what? Sometimes plans have to change in mid-flight.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>So Tim and James look at each other, and without saying a word...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> Boom. We got out of the boat and...</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Splashed into the water.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> And I see a shadow. This massive animal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> A hazy silhouette.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> And we just started swimming.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> To the whale. About a hundred feet away.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> You know, parts of blubber and skin floating around.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> 35 feet. 20 feet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And then they see it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> My goodness, this thing is the size of a school bus.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>A female humpback whale is one of the largest creatures on the planet, 50 feet long, 50 tons, and this particular whale wasn't in a kind of C shape, where it's head was at the top of the water, but it's tail was almost pointed directly down.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> It was almost like somebody was pulling her down by the tail to the bottom of the ocean.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Yeah, there was probably 20 crab traps, 2,000 pounds at least just tied up to the tail.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> She had just become an anchor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> An anchor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> And to see her not be able to move that tail, and to struggle...</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Just like&mdash;gasp! The whale was actually really laboring to breathe. Just a little puff, and there was just rope everywhere.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> It went around the whale's mouth, around the whale's head.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Across her eye, over her back.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Wrapped around the pectoral fins, all the way down to his tail. I thought there was no hope.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> There was no chance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> We're looking at a dead whale. The whale just doesn't know it yet. But I knew that I had to try, I'm gonna swim to the whale. And as soon as I decide okay I'm gonna swim to the whale, well the whale decides she wasn't gonna have that.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>What she'd do?</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> She put up her pectoral fin, which is like her arm, and this pectoral fin is about 15 feet long, about four feet wide. And she just splashed down the water in front of me. You know, it's the size of an airplane wing coming down on top of you, just inches from my head.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> So, you know, at that point I backed off and waited.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Waited for the whale to settle down.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> She was physically exhausted.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Which she did, and then they both swim back. James goes to the tail and Tim, up to the whale's head.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> You know I was there with a six-inch dive knife.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Cutting out line right near her eye.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Which was the size of a grapefruit. And her eye was moving, keeping an eye on me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Really?</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>He would go left, her eye would go left. He'd go right, her eye would go right.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> She was tracking me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And all the while, they're just cutting as much rope as they can.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> You really had to saw at it. It was very strong, very tight. Sometimes I'd cut a rope, and it would be a loose rope, and all of a sudden something else would tighten up, which was the one rope that would let it all free.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>This whole process took hours, but finally James gets to the end of it. He's at the tail, sawing his way through that big clump of line, and he realizes at a certain point that to cut through all that line...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> I'm going to have to stab the whale to get my knife underneath the rope.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Ah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> It was that tight, though. I jabbed my knife into the whale's tail, and pulled the rope and then cut it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And once the rope went&mdash;fwip fwip fwip fwip, fwoo!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> It was a very surreal moment looking down and seeing the 20 crab traps and buoys just disappear into the abyss.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And just like that the whale was gone.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> I'm spinning around going \"Where'd she go? Where'd she go?\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But as the water settled, they realized they'd done it. They freed her.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> As soon as I came up I was like \"Woo-hoo!\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Wow!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> Whooping it up and yelling.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Unbelievable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> I was screaming.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Can you imagine it?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Now here's where the story takes a pretty startling turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> High-fiving.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>In fact, the whole reason we wanted to tell this story to begin with is for what happens next. So Tim and James and the other divers are in the water, they're celebrating, high-fiving, and then all of a sudden James looks down.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> Next thing I know I have this 50-ton whale coming right at me, and I'm thinking \"Oh my God, stop! I just saved you.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Wait, so this whale is coming at you from below, like Jaws?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> Yeah, she's rising up towards me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> Oh God!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> And I was just thinking this is going to hurt, and...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> And when she was only inches away from my chest, she stopped. And pushed me on the chest backwards, and then released me, and then kind of pushed again, and then release, and pushed again and again.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Wow!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> And then she swam up right next to me, peeks her head up above the water so that her eye was above the water, and then came up and looked directly at me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And for what felt like 30 seconds, he says, she just stared at him.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> The pupil didn't move around. She wasn't looking for anything else. She was just looking at me. You're in the presence of something that great, it makes you feel small.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> It really was a very emotional feeling. You know, I wasn't quite sure what to make out of it, make of it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But then he says she went off to the next diver.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> And did the same thing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> I remembered distinctly I was 18 inches away from her eye, and she just looked at me and let me touch her, and then swam off.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> And then she went off to the next diver and did the same thing, and the next person and did the same thing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>One by one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> Coming up right next to him. Looking at him really good, you know, inches away, eyeballing him.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOLLY DREWYARD:</strong> She swam around every diver.</p>\r\n<p><strong>MICK MENAGO: </strong>All the guys got it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOLLY DREWYARD:</strong> So it was about dusk. The water was glass flat. I was sitting at the helm of the boat just in awe. And they had to leave the whale. She didn't want to leave them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Now there's a real question here: what exactly was that whale doing&mdash;or saying? Was she saying anything? And if you ask James or Tim or Mick or any of the other divers that were in the water that day they'll tell you...</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIM YOUNG:</strong> I felt this whale was really thanking us.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> I know it sounds crazy, but I could see the look in her eye. This mammal, this 50-ton mammal was literally saying thanks. Thanks for helping me out. And, you know, I'll bring that to my grave knowing the gratification that I felt.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Hmm. Wow!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>So what do you think? I mean, here's the question, really.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Uh-huh.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Was that whale saying thank you?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Was the whale saying&mdash;well, I think the whale was saying something. I mean, a whale, if she was just freed of her ropes, I would think she would just go off and say \"Whew, I'm free!\" So the fact that she would...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>That she hung around.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And make these specific...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Circles, eyeballs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: ...</strong>visits. Like I don't know I feel that she, there's something intentional about that. She didn't leave anyone out, right?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>No, she...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>She went to everybody.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>In fact, according to one of the guys on the boat, she actually went to the boats and did the same thing to the boats.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>She said thank you to the boats?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Hmm, well then. So she was looking at the people, but she also thought that the craft was somebody she should say thank you, or say deal with.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So maybe she was just psyched, maybe she was just&mdash;I really don't know what she&mdash;I mean I don't&mdash;I don't feel completely comfortable just saying&mdash;of course, I know what I want to feel.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah, me too.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But let's just try to straighten up for a second. We have a guy named Clive Wynne. He teaches at the university...</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Hello?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Hey!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Oh hi, is this Mr. Clive Wynne?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Yeah, this is Clive Wynne.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Hi.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Clive is with the psychology department at the University of Florida.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Who am I talking&mdash;who's this?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>This is Jad from Radiolab in...</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Right. Hi, Jad.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Clive also happens to be an expert on animal psychology.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Hi. This is Robert also.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Hi, Robert.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Can you hear us pretty well?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>I can hear you pretty well. I'm&mdash;I'm wondering how well I'm gonna distinguish your voices.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs] Oh, no need to do that.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Treat us as a unitary figure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>[laughs] Okay.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But so let me&mdash;let me begin. Now this is Robert talking.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Mm-hmm.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>We'll tell you a story, and we want to know...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>What you think of the story?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So once upon a time and not too long ago...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>All right, we're gonna fast forward a bit because we ran Clive through the entire whale story, front to back.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So my question to you is: if a diver said to you, \"This whale said thank you to me,\" what would you say?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Well, I would be put in a difficult situation, because I don't doubt that what these people experienced was a very moving moment with that whale, but the problem is I just don't speak whale, so...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: ...</strong>I don't know what thank you looks like in whale. If I'm gonna be a cynic about it I would say, \"Well, the whale has been trapped for I believe over a day, and may just be disoriented.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Well but this was&mdash;this was parking herself with one individual and then moving to the next. That's not a distracted&mdash;that looks like its got some intention.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>It shows some interest in the individuals. I'll give you that. But how do we&mdash;how do we get from that, to deducing that the whale is trying to express thanks?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>What do you mean? It's just...</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Let's play a different example. Let's suppose that you found a bear in the woods that was caught up in some netting that ended up in the woods. And you work for hours to free the bear, and then the bear eats you. Does that mean that the&mdash;the bears are an ungrateful species of animal?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yes. [laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>No, I don't truly believe that.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Right. Well, so I mean it would make as much sense to ascribe ingratitude to the bear as it does to ascribe gratitude to the whale. I just don't think that's a useful way of trying to understand animals. And I think it&mdash;ultimately it demeans them, because it means that instead of living in a world that's full of the diversity of wonderful creatures, each with its own ways of relating to other members of its own species and other members of other species, we say \"Well, we don't live in a world like that. We live in a world that's basically a world of human beings. It doesn't matter some of these human beings have fur suits on.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>\"Some of these human beings weigh hundreds of tons, and live under the ocean, and can hold their breath for a very long time. None of that really matters ultimately they're all basically like us.\" And I just don't find that satisfying.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Hmm. Are you saying that you don't know if there's a possibility of sharing, or that you don't think that there's a possibility of sharing at a emotional level between two species?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>I don't doubt that there is the possibility of sharing between two species. I mean you&mdash;I see it with dogs all the time. But I think it would be a mistake if we thought that the love we feel for our dogs, is the same feeling that the dog has back to us. It has different qualities, and it's very...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But when you pet your dog, and it wags its tail, and it seems happy to see you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Do you just like not trust that?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Well okay, so let me make clear that I wear two hats. When I'm talking about a dog, particularly a pet of my own, I'm wearing&mdash;I have two possible hats I can wear, and one is that when the dog pants back at me I just hug the dog and, you know, let him kiss me, and that's&mdash;that's life with a dog. But if I'm&mdash;if I'm now wearing my scientific hat, I'm getting my blanket as wet as I possibly can.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Then I ask myself what do these behaviors mean among dogs? There's a beautiful study that came out recently from Alexandra Horowitz.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> I'm Alexandra Horowitz, and I study dog cognition.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Where do we find her?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>She's&mdash;well, she's around the corner from you. She's at Barnard College.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>So we sent our producer Soren Wheeler.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN WHEELER:</strong> Yo. That's me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>To meet her, and he ended up hanging out with her, and her dog Finnegan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong>Yeah. Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>In a park.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> Oh. Oh, good snuffle. That's a nice snuffle. You want to snuffle with the mic?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>She did this beautiful experiment that shows that when people think their dog is looking guilty...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> Ears back, eyes lowered, tail between the legs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Actually, the dog is just being submissive.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong>So here's what she did. She tracked down a bunch of dog owners.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> Posted on Craigslist, and put out posters.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong>And she found a bunch of owners who believe that like most dog owners do, that their dog feels guilt.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> Yes, my dog feels guilty when he's done something wrong.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong>And then she set up a situation where all of the dog owners had to scold their dogs because, you know, they'd been told that their dogs did something bad. But the trick of the experiment is that only half the dogs had done something wrong.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Half the dogs had actually been naughty, and half the dogs had not been naughty. But then she...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> Misinformed the owners.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>...lied to half of the owners.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> So we lied to the owners.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong>So even the owners whose dogs hadn't been bad, thought their dogs had been bad. So everybody scolded their dog.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> Almost everyone did this the same way, which was to say no loudly to their dogs, and maybe put their hands on their hip and just express disapproval</p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong>No. Finnegan!</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> Yes! Finnegan!</p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong>I can't believe you ate...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> Finnegan. Oh. It's okay.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong>See, Finnegan just made the look, even though he hadn't done anything wrong. And that's essentially what she found. Even the non-guilty dogs made the guilty look.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>It didn't matter whether the dog had transgressed or not. All that mattered was whether it was being chastised by its owner.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So bad dog, bad dog!</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Right.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>That creates the look, not the deed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>That's exactly right.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But&mdash;but for me the pivotal question here is not whether or not they all had the look, but what's attached to that look. What feeling in the dog is attached to that guilty look? Maybe the dogs who were falsely accused still felt bad.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>[laughs]. Well maybe they did. Maybe they did, and maybe there are angels on top of this control console here.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>I thought it was a perfectly valid question.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Anyhow, we should thank Alexandra Horowitz. Her latest book is called Inside of a Dog. <strong>ROBERT: </strong>And before we end this section, have we resolved the question of what was that whale doing with those people? Was she saying thank you or no?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>No, and do we ever resolve any questions at all?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Well, we try. We get a little closer, and we kind of just go...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>No, we have not resolved it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So we will try harder?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But but but but in our next section a mere 70 seconds away we will try very hard to actually get scientific about it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Good.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD ABUMRAD:</strong> Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT KRULWICH:</strong> And I'm Robert Krulwich.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>This is Radiolab. Today's hour...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Animal minds. Animal minds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Right.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Do&mdash;can&mdash;can one animal really know what's going on in another animal's head?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah, like really know?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Really know.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Thanks for meeting us.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>So we were thinking about that whale story that we heard before the break.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yep.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>You know, where the divers meet the whale, and they were sure the whale was saying thanks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAMES MOSKITO:</strong> Literally saying thanks. Thanks for helping me out.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Okay that is their opinion, but we wanted to know, like, what can you actually scientifically say about that kind of exchange? And that question led us...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PRODUCER:</strong> Introduce yourself.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>...to this guy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>My name is Patrick Hoff. I am a neuroscientist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>He may have found a way of separating the animals, of knowing which animals can genuinely have human emotions, and which can't.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>It starts&mdash;it starts in 1995. We were studying the anatomy of the human cingulate cortex.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>That's part of the brain that's right here. Kind of between your eyes, but down.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>And a student in my lab, Esther Nimchinsky...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>She was looking at some brains, and she saw...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Something odd.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>These very slender bipolar neurons. I've never seen a neuron like that. Maybe it's abnormal, it's probably pathological.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Just to be sure, she got some slides of other human brains, looked in the same place.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>And we...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>There it was again.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>...started to see them in...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And again.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>And we were very pleased. So okay, we have discovered a new cell type. Whoo! Something that is unique to humans.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But then they went to the library and discovered that some guy...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Who's name is Constantin von Economo.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Costanto...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Constantin von Economo.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>This Romanian guy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: ...</strong>von Economo.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>He'd seen these cells 70 years ago.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>And he named them spindle cells.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Because of their shape.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Oh, that must have been a very sad day for Esther.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>No. No, no.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Because now they believe that these little brain cells may be a key to how humans relate to one another, and whether or not other creatures can relate to us in the same way.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Right.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Is it possible to&mdash;for us to see a spindle cell?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Yeah, we can&mdash;we can show you spindle cells.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Patrick Hoff took us down the hall.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yep.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Jad went first and parked him in front of a big microscope.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Here, you can look at it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Will it be obvious to me?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>From looking at it?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Crossing the middle of the field, you can see a series of tall slender...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>It's making me dizzy a little bit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>We have one, two, three, four, five.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Is that the spindles?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Oh, they're everywhere!</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Oh. You want to see them?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>What do you mean do I want to see them? I mean, yeah! Here you hold the mic. Oh, yeah! There's a whole troop of them, and they're long and skinny and purple.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>It's funny because the normal brain cells which you can also see in there are like dot, dot, dot, but these ones are doooo! Like little purple bananas.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Like a team of purple bananas.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And the thing that makes these cells so interesting...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>All seeming to head off in this direction.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>...according to Patrick Hoff is that, you know, in the normal brain cells, they just talk to their neighbors. But these because they're so long...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>They seem to be yelling across a big distance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Exactly. We know that these cells send an action at some distance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>It's across the valley.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Yeah, it's across the valley, exactly. It's projecting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But projecting what? And from where to where? Well, Patrick Hoff doesn't entirely know, but he says he can make a pretty good guess based on&mdash;well, if you look at the microscope you do notice some things.<br /><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Yeah, yeah. So here, here, on the top of the spindle points toward the surface of the brain always.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>The top, he says, seems to shoot up, towards those more modern parts of the brain that involve...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>High-order cognition.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah&mdash;language, abstract thinking. Whereas the bottom of the spindle seems to shoot...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Down.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>...deep down.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>The lower centers in the brain.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Towards those older parts of our brain that involve feelings, emotions, instinct. So perhaps&mdash;this is what Patrick Hoff thinks&mdash;that these cells are a kind of network, a really important one that allows the different parts of our inner selves to connect. Like, you've got the parts of us down here that feel things can now communicate with the parts of us up here that think things. And this is an oversimplification of course, but the point, the larger point is that this is exactly what happens when you look into the eyes of another human being. Because it begins with a kind of thought. Your eyes seem sad, but then that thought within you travels a great distance and connects with the feeling of sadness, so that you feel sad too.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>I mean, it's the basis of kind of empathy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Exactly, exactly. You know I see you're happy, you know, so that I feel good about it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>You know, and consider those times&mdash;I mean not just empathy where, like, your thoughts and feelings are in conflict, and they've gotta really talk to one another.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Like for example, when you get in front of me at the microphone yet again.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And I hate you, but I know that I have to work with you, so I&mdash;I sit on that feeling. I just sit on my&mdash;it's going down to the bottom of my brain, but I say take a nap.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>See, that's the best part of your spindle situation is that it's not just that thoughts connect to feelings, but those thoughts can sometimes suppress feelings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JONAH LEHRER: </strong>Yeah, I&mdash;you know, I think that's the idea is that humans in social interactions can't rely on these hard-wired emotions in the same way other animals might be able to.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>That's Jonah Lehrer, science writer. A regular Radiolab contributor, and a guy we often call to help us make sense of things.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JONAH LEHRER: </strong>You know, we can't like a dog just hump every other dog and see what happens.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JONAH LEHRER: </strong>We've&mdash;we've gotta flirt and be funny and, you know, buy a couple of drinks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JONAH LEHRER: </strong>But&mdash;but that was&mdash;you guys have to cut that because I don't want hate mail from...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>I am so astonished!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JONAH LEHRER: </strong>Well, I was like, \"Wow!\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>We've gotta use that, Jad.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JONAH LEHRER: </strong>I just&mdash;I just turned into a frat boy. So&mdash;but the point being that our social interactions are very complicated, in that we can't rely&mdash;it's much tougher for humans to rely on simply these hard-wired, primitive instincts. You know, so the job of spindle cells is to simply broadcast content to the rest of the brain.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Because without our whole brain involved, we'd never be able to navigate the social world and make any kind of connection.<br /><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Right. So if spindle cells then allow us to talk gently and emotionally to one another, the question is&mdash;this is the question for the hour&mdash;what about intra-species? Is it intra- or inter-?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Intra.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>To look within.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Like, an intranet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yeah, that's inside.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>I think across species is what you mean.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Does any other animal have spindle cells?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And as it happens...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>So where I'm taking you to my cold room.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>...just down the hall from his office, Professor Hoff has a freezer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Where I store the specimens.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>This is a very, very big door, too.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>So...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Full of brains.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Yes, so it's going to get really cooler here.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>All different kinds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>We have brains of all your species, the cetaceans are over there. We have the great apes around here.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>This is the whale wall.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>That's the whale wall, yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>He's got dozens and dozens of brains in buckets and in jars. And he keeps them all organized where each category of species has its own shelf.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>You have more apes down there with gorillas and orangutans.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Aah!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Whew!</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>It was really cold in there.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>So what they did was they took a bunch of those brains off the shelf and walked them down the hall to the lab, and put little pieces of them under a microscope. They didn't expect to find any of those bizarro neurons in any of these other creatures because he was pretty sure...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>This is something that is unique to humans.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>One day we were looking at the brain of the humpback whale, and we stumble on spindle cells, plenty of spindle cells.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Oh, so what was that? Did you&mdash;were you surprised?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>And I was there, and said \"Okay, this is fascinating.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>You weren't expecting that?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>I was not at all expecting that.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>But on the other hand...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>Here we have the&mdash;the humpback whale which is a very social animal. They&mdash;they form clans, they communicate. The males have a song. They hunt together, they develop hunting strategies, which requires perfect coordination of many whales. So they have to act together to do that.<br /><strong>JAD: </strong>Now if acting together is the key, you know, in having complex social structures, well then these things shouldn't just be limited to whales. And in fact, over the years Hoff and other scientists have found spindle cells in chimpanzees, elephants, dolphins, gorillas. Which begs the question, like, if we want to have an experience with another creature, and not just at the zoo, but a real shared experience, do those creatures need to have these things?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Do you think the existence of spindle cells creates more of a possibility of having that cross-species sharing moment?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PATRICK HOFF: </strong>I think so. If we assume that these cells have such an influence on the sociability of the species, it is very likely that you would experience something of that kind with a species that has them. I doubt you would get a very good experience if you were trying to do this with a hyena.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JONAH LEHRER: </strong>So maybe what we see when we look into, you know, these sad eyes of a blue whale, or when we look into, you know, the eyes of an elephant cradling a baby elephant, which are just the cutest things on earth, maybe what we recognize is&mdash;is that same flavor of emotion, that same inner life of feeling. Maybe&mdash;and this is a big maybe&mdash;maybe that inner life requires spindle cells.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But how big is that maybe? I mean, it sounds like a really maybe maybe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JONAH LEHRER: </strong>I mean, you know, at some point this is all just a&mdash;I think this is still very theoretical.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And in fact if you ask people, like Clive Wynne the fellow who&mdash;who pooh-poohed our whale thank you from before?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Mm-hmm.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Ask Clive, like, could you look at an animal and find something in the animal that says yep if he has that, he's got feeling?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Well, wrong. I don't for a moment imagine that there's gonna be a type of nerve cell or a type of structure in the brain which is gonna be such an acid test of whether an animal has a particular psychological capacity that we can then find that kind of neuron and say, \"Well, now we know,\" without having to look at the behavior of the animal, now we know that this species has this or that psychological ability.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Well let me ask the question a different way. I mean, do you think&mdash;spindle cells or no spindle cells, let's just toss them out for a second&mdash;do you think there are a category of creatures that are more likely to have empathic experiences with us? Would you draw a line between beings?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Well the thing I would&mdash;the thing I would emphasize if we're looking for empathy between different species, is their developmental experiences.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>To make his point, Clive told us about this experiment. He says let's take a chimp with all the spindle cells inside the chimp brain in there. Put the chimp in a room, and in front of the chimp let's put two cups face down. Now one of the cups has a grape or something delicious under it. And the chimp doesn't know where the grape is. It could be under cup A or cup B. So what you the experimenter do is you simply point to the cup that has the grape. Like, that's the one. That one right there.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>And all the animal has to do is to go to the cup that's pointed to. It seems simple enough.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But chimps, Clive says, chimps...</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Find this stunningly difficult to understand.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Get this wrong.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>What do you mean?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>I mean, they just look at you pointing, and they look at you pointing, and they look, and you're pointing, and they just go what?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Whereas dogs...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Who don't have spindle cells.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>...most pet dogs get this from the get go.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Wait, dogs can do this and chimps can't?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>They quite spontaneously recognize that you should go where&mdash;where they point.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And Clive says the explanation here is not that dogs have some special cell in their brain. It's simply because...</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Because they grow up in our households.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>They grow up with us.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Right.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Huh.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>To test this idea he did the same study.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>The pointing one?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yep. Except this time with some wolves.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Because wolves are the animals from which dogs are descended, but they haven't lived in human households, obviously.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And normally, like the chimps, wolves totally screw up the pointing test.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>But we've done some tests on some wolves that were hand reared by human beings and are very friendly to human beings, and we find that those wolves behave just like the dogs. That they are just as good at following the human pointing to find the food.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Really? Did you have to train them, or...</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>No, we did not train them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>They just picked it up?</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Well, they just picked it up. But these are exceptional wolves insofar as they were reared by human beings. They were bottle fed when they were wee babies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Ah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Ah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Because there are things that go on earlier in our development that are crucial, and that include learning who are your&mdash;who are your kind. What the&mdash;who am I? What am I? And you learn that in a critical period in your early life by looking around you and seeing who you're interacting with. Pretty much every dog you might meet has learned to accept humans as social companions, and that's because it was reared in a human home, and because evolution has prepared it with a relatively slow development so that it's pretty easy to tame a dog. The wolf on the other hand, it goes through its childhood, and adolescence in the blink of an eye, in the course of just a handful of weeks. And so it's actually extremely difficult to successfully hand rear a wolf because you have so little time available to you, and you have to invest 24 hours a day, seven days a week during that brief period that a wolf is open to the possibility of learning who its companions might be.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>That's really interesting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Ooh, that's so interesting. I'm now sitting here thinking...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>...boy, if I could raise a whale with a baby bottle, then I would know whether the whale was saying thank you to me because I would've learned&mdash;it's not like I have to learn whale, but whale would've learned human.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Well, that's right. I mean, of course this is completely hypothetical. The whale is a really bad example to choose.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>But my guess would be if you bottle fed a whale, you would get a whale that might plausibly do something like a behavior that expresses thanks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs] That is such a hard mental image to conjure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Well, that's right. That's right.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Robert bottle feeding a whale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yeah, well because we have to keep rising to the surface for 21 years to breathe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Before I actually get to the experiment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>Yes, there's a number of drawbacks to that experiment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Radiolab will continue in a moment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>I'm Robert Krulwich.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>This is Radiolab. Today, kind of a hard topic to describe. We're calling it animal minds, animal minds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Or maybe the better way to say this is minds other than our own.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Which would be the animals, no?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>That's the animals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>We're animals though. Yeah you're right.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>No, yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah you're right.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yeah, so we live with other&mdash;yeah so we live with&mdash;we're having enough trouble just talking to each other. [laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But imagine if I were trying, if you were a Labrador.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>That'd be tough.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>See then we'd have a problem. Or a whale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>No, maybe we wouldn't. That's kind of what we're looking at. How much can you really share with, you know a Labrador or a whale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Right, and we're not solving this problem in this show at all.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>No.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But maybe we can do this. Maybe instead of talking to scientists about other minds, maybe we should talk to...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>A writer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yeah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PRODUCER:</strong> Paul can you hear me? Paul can you hear? Paul, oh Paul. Paul? Paul?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>The writer we chose to look for, you may now know, was named Paul.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PRODUCER:</strong> Okay stand by.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Put Paul through.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PRODUCER:</strong> I'm not hearing anything.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>He's the author of any number of travel books, novels.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Didn't he win a big prize?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>I'm sure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Yes. Is that Jad?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yes, hi.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> J- A- D?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>That's me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Like a Pulitzer or one of the&mdash;one of the big ones.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Okay.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>No, he didn't win a Pulitzer, but he&mdash;he won the prize of my heart when he wrote the Patagonian Express.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Oh, so you're taping. Okay great.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Anyhow, Paul Theroux travels all around the world writing about all kinds of things. But the reason we called him is for something that actually happened in his backyard.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Which luckily for him happens to be in the state of Hawaii.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> I own seven acres on a slope, a west-facing slope on the north shore of Oahu.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Oh!</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> And I had very, very long grass. And someone said \"Oh, I know what you need are some geese. They'll take care of that grass.\" So I got a couple.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And you decided not to go to the hardware store and buy a lawnmower. You decided to buy two animate birds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> That's right. I would have needed a really, really serious industrial mower. Instead, I got two non-industrial geese. Well, I actually got three, two ganders and a goose, and a strange thing happened. One of the ganders imprinted on me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>So what does that mean?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So it means the baby chick boy looked at you...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Yes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And, and...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> The first moving thing they see is the mother figure. This goose became very attached, very protective. It would sit in my lap. When another goose came up it would peck at them. It was both protective and attentive.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But as the gander grew up, strange things began to happen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> First, it became detached from me, then aggressive toward me, and then needed me. It was very strange, and it made me think I want to get some more geese, and I want to read more about them, and then&mdash;and then watch them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So he&mdash;well he asked friends, and friends said to him \"Look, if you want to know everything that's important to know about geese you have to read E.B. White.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Most people mention E.B. White when they talk about geese, and of course I know and love E.B. White.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And if you're not a Martian you probably love E.B. White too.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Well, you&mdash;I mean. What do you mean? People it's possible...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>How many people have read Stuart Little, or how many people have read Charlotte's Web?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>It's true. True.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And if you don't love the children's fiction, he's certainly one of the great, greatest of all American essayists.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah, see that's the point. He's one of the great American writers. He actually wrote the bible for writing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>The Elements of Style.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>The Elements of Style.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>By Strunk.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Which is still the bible for writing, weirdly, and it was written like 50 years ago.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So when people point to anything by E.B. White, you point seriously.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And in this case, very late in life after he'd moved up to a cabin in Maine, he was in his 70s, and this particular essay we're gonna talk about is called very simply...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> The Geese.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>The Geese.</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, E.B. White:</strong> Allen Cove, July 9, 1971. I have had a pair of elderly gray geese&mdash;a goose and a gander&mdash;living on this place for a number of years, and they have been my friends.]</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So Paul Theroux opened the essay fully expecting to learn all about geese. But then he kept running across these little phrases and adjectives that made him cringe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> You know, he talks about a gosling that grows into&mdash;I'm quoting now...</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, E.B. White:</strong> A real dandy.]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX: </strong>...a real dandy.</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, E.B. White:</strong> Full of pompous thoughts and surly gestures.]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Pompous thoughts and surly gestures. You know? [laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>I mean, come on. I mean, doesn't that make the goose a little bit more easy to relate to?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> All right take one word. Malice.</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, E.B. White:</strong> I could not tell whether the look in his eye was one of malice or affection.]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Malice? Malice is a word you use for, you know Mussolini, or, you know, somebody else. Not for&mdash;not for a goose.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But what's the sin in that? If a man who's a professional storyteller, and one of the greatest ones, says \"Let me tell you about my geese,\" and then talks about them as though they were uncles and aunts and neighbors with moods that are distinctly human. So what?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Well, I suppose you could say so, or you could say but, but so what if he put them in, you know, little Halloween costumes too, for that matter, so what?</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> But I'm in the writing business, the writing business should be unsparing. He could be quite unsparing himself in his writing. You're giving E.B. White too much license if you're saying it really doesn't matter. It does matter to me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>And the reason it matters, says Paul Theroux, is that E.B. White got so attached to the idea of those geese as aging critters like himself that he missed something deep and important about the geese.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> The elements of that behavior that is&mdash;that is pure goose.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Paul pointed to the end of the essay.</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, E.B. White:</strong> Suddenly I heard sounds of a rumble outside in the barnyard where the ganders were.]</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Where a formerly great gander gets unseated by a younger male goose. There's a big fight, lots of squawking. And the old gander loses.</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, E.B. White:</strong> I watched as he threaded his way slowly down the narrow path between clumps of thistles and daisies. His head was barely visible above the grasses, but his broken spirit was plain to any eye. I felt very deeply his sorrow and his defeat.]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Wow, the defeated gander goes off. Well, this isn't true at all. When a gander loses a battle he goes off, gets his strength back, and waits for a chance to attack again. That gander is gonna come back and fight again.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So you're saying he got it wrong about the geese?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Yes, of course. Of course. Here is a man who is solitary, he's a New Yorker who goes to Maine and becomes a gentleman farmer of a kind. And begins to relate to his geese, and then writes about them as though he's one of them. I know I'm not one of them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But if you can't use words that are, you know, very human and psychological words, and if you can't because you're not a goose have whatever it is that geese have on their insides, then what if you wanted to share something with a goose? And I'd bet you you do. Is there anyway in which you could honestly describe yourself as a friend of any of these geese?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> I would say, you know, that this is a very good question. I had a very \"surly,\" to use an E.B. White word, a very&mdash;a very rambunctious gander, and he got very sick. You know, the thing is sitting on the ground just fouling its nest. I thought he was really gonna die. And I nursed him back to health. I gave him an antibiotic with a turkey baster, and it took about three or four weeks. And the first thing he did when he was nursed back to health was he got up on two legs and I came up with the turkey baster to give him one last drink, and he bit me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> And I thought...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Where did he bite you?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> He bit my leg. Hard. And I thought, \"Okay he's back to health.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>You didn't think, \"Ow! How could you?\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> Well I thought he's&mdash;he's healthy. He's healthy again, and he's behaving just as goose would.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But don't you see though that if the moment of true&mdash;of your true most goose-y moment is a moment when you're with a goose that you help bites you, then you are out of this story in effect.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> I absolutely agree with that. In all of this there's an implied loneliness. I'm not his friend, I'm not a feathered creature. I'm a human being among birds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Although curiously, Paul Theroux does have an approach to communing with his geese. He takes a chair, puts it on the lawn, plops down in the chair and disappears.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> You know, my writing day ends in the early afternoon. I have lunch, and after lunch there's a long sunny period in the afternoon when I'm alone, I'm with the geese. And I sit around with them, and try to make out what they're doing among each other, and paying no particular attention to me. It's simply watching the world as it was. You're seeing creatures who are behaving as though cities don't exist, presidents don't exist, governments don't exist, roads don't exist.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Ah.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> As if it's before the fall.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Hmm.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL THEROUX:</strong> As though it's the peaceable kingdom. Simply watching animals who are content doing their thing. Then you feel a bit like Adam.</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>ALEXANDRA HOROWITZ:</strong> Radiolab is produced by Jad Abumrad and Soren Wheeler, Michael Rafael, Ellen Horne.]</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>CLIVE WYNNE: </strong>And Lulu Miller.

So we're gonna play for you one final story. It's kind of a continuation of Paul Theroux and his geese, except it involves a very different guy in a very different climate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>First of all who&mdash;who are you? What's your name?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> My name's Paul Nicklen, and I'm a contributing photographer to National Geographic Magazine.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Paul Nicklen is basically National Geographic's Arctic guy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> It's&mdash;I've been pegged as their polar specialist.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And this particular tale involves his attempt to photograph one of the great Arctic predators.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> The Leopard seal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Leopard seal, which by reputation is a very nasty creature.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Preface to this story is in 2003, tragically a scientist was actually killed. Kirsty Brown was doing underwater research, and she was taken down by a leopard seal and drowned.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Was she just yanked off the ice, or...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> She was swimming and it just came up and grabbed her.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Ooh.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> And took her down to 300 feet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Nonetheless our story starts with Paul and his guide Godan. They're in a boat in the Arctic Ocean looking for seals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> The first seal we encountered, I'd never seen a leopard seal before, and we came around into this bay where there was a penguin colony. And right away Godan, who's seen many, many leopard seals, he said to me \"You know, bloody hell, that's the biggest seal I've ever seen.\" And she came up to boat with a penguin in her mouth, and she went underneath the boat and she started ramming the penguin underneath the hull of the boat, lifting the bow out of the water. And that's when Godan looks to me and he says \"Paul, it's time for you to get in the water, yeah?\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> In his thick Swedish accent.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Wow, were you freaking out?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> I had dry mouth just from the nervousness. I was trembling and, you know, I put my mask on and slipped over into the 29-degree Fahrenheit water. And there she was, instantly right there. Massive, huge.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Well, how huge?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Probably over a thousand pounds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Oh my God!</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Twelve feet long. She dropped her penguin, she came right over to me, and she opened up her mouth. And she engulfed the front of the camera, her canines were on top of my head to where below my chin&mdash;you know, I'm basically staring down her throat.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>I can't believe you managed to take a picture of this. Because I'm looking at this picture, and these teeth are huge!</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> The canines.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>You know, like, massive!</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>So you were doing business at this moment?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Yeah, I'm working at that point.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>You can even see the textures of the seal's tongue. Like, she has these little fibers on them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Oh, it's 180-degree view, so you had to get that perspective. I'm basically in the mouth to get that shot.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Wow. So then what happened?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> She backs off, looks at me, sniff my flipper, touched them with nose, poked me in the bum, came up did this open mouth threat display again, and then she swims away.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Oof.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Wow. I was just getting ready to swim back to the Zodiac, you know, I've been in the water for quite a while, and I'm cold. And all of a sudden she shows up with a freshly caught live penguin chick in her mouth.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Huh!</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> And I'm sitting there staring at her, and she stops about 10 feet away from. And she's got the penguin by the feet, and the penguin is flapping its flippers trying to get away. She lines the penguin up to face perfectly in my direction and she lets it go. The penguin swam right by me, and she chases off after it and grabs it, comes back and does this again and again and again.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Why?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Yeah. I mean, what was she doing?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> At first, I couldn't figure out what was going on. I thought maybe she was having a hard time eating it, and then it dawned on me she was trying to feed me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Did you make any attempt during this period to say no thank you?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> No. Nope I'm so&mdash;in such disbelief at this point, I'm just trying to capture it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Well, didn't you feel compelled as a social human to just offer some kind of gestural explanation. I mean, if it was me I would have made some look like, \"Come&mdash;I don't eat that stuff!\" Or...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Or maybe it's like you take&mdash;you take the penguin at that point.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Well, I mean I couldn't catch him.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>I mean when in Rome, you know?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> The penguin is swimming 15 miles an hour, you know?</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Oh, so you mean when she lets go, it just goes&mdash;fyoom!</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Like a bullet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>No, he's pathetic is what he's saying. He's saying, \"I'm a pathetic creature, I can't actually catch the thing.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> I'm thinking exposures, get the shot, keep shooting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>You're such a photo dude, you know?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> [laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Well I'm&mdash;I work for National Geographic.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> I don't want to anthropomorphize too much, but as the penguin was swimming by this huge seal, she looked over at me and I swear she had a look of disgust in her face.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> So she goes off and gets another penguin, and this penguin now is quite weak and tired looking, so I think she's worn it down. She lets the penguin go, the penguin takes off. She grabs it, does that a couple of more times.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And you're still not eating the penguin.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Right. Next encounter was bringing me dead penguins. And sometimes she would just drop off a dead penguin right on top of the camera, and she would just sit there with this dejected look on her face, staring at me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>[laughs]</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> And then she went to the stage of flipping dead penguins on top of my head, and trying to force feed me these penguins. Telling me at this point, you know, \"Eat these damn penguins, I'm trying to feed you. And why won't you eat my penguins? Eat the penguins.\" And then she would start to eat the penguins right in front of me, and show me how to eat them. She would rip them apart on the surface, get the skin off them, and she's shredding them in the water in front of me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And&mdash;and how much time is passing here? I mean, are we talking minutes, hours?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> This went on for four days.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Four days!</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Four days? [laughs] Oh God!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>And when you're in the water, you know, day after day, what's happening for you at this point? Are you still just a guy with a camera, or...</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> I mean, I was starting to fall in love with this seal. It's just this animal that's just so intelligent and so powerful, and it can kill you in an instant, yet your&mdash;I mean...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>But when you say you were in love, were you in love with the idea of this, or did you really like her?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> I really liked her. She was beautiful, she was big. She had this&mdash;this beautiful face, beautiful silver color to her. She kind of glowed underwater. I'm just so in love with this seal at this point. I'm not sleeping at night, I have a hard time eating. I just can't wait to see her. I can't&mdash;the first thing in the morning, you know, the first sign of light I'm in that zodiac.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> And then on the fourth day is when, you know, I was thinking okay maybe she's weary of me, and she's getting tired of me, so I'm just gonna totally leave her alone. That's when I started going off and presenting myself to other seals who were swimming around the rookery.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> And I was in the water, and the same big female came up to me, and she started to do all these really beautiful ballet-like moves. I'm photographing her, and looking at her, and all of a sudden she drops her penguin, she turns upside down, and she does this big guttural \"Go go go go,\" this big jarring noise that's vibrating my whole body. I can really feel it in my chest, it's so loud. And I'm thinking am I being attacked? She finally told me that she's sick of me and wants me off her feeding grounds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> But, as soon as she did that, another leopard seal shot out from right behind me. And so this leopard seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that noise to chase that seal away, a smaller seal. She chased the seal away, it too had a penguin. She grabbed its penguin and brought me that seal's penguin and dropped it off in front of me.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Wow!</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Wow!</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>You're a lucky guy. Wow.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> I mean, I'm almost getting emotional reliving that. I mean, it's very powerful.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Have you ever been in love with an animal quite this way before?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Never. Never.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Have you every had an experience with&mdash;with another human that rivals this?</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Perhaps when I was kid with my mom. Someone taking care of you, and feeling safe and nurtured, and protected, but I've never had that in my life as an adult.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>It sounds&mdash;this is such an interesting species moment here.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Yeah, it sounds like you're doing something...</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>You're transgressing or something.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>It sounds like you're stealing something from the gods right here, right at this moment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> I mean, I don't know what words I can find to explain it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong>Hmm.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong>Thank you so much.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAUL NICKLEN:</strong> Thank you, guys.</p>\r\n<p>[<strong>LISTENER:</strong> Radiolab was created by Jad Abumrad and is edited by Soren Wheeler.

A couple hours later, to his own surprise, he saved the life of the President of the United States. But in the days that followed, Sipple’s split-second act of heroism turned into a rationale for making his personal life into political opportunity. What happens next makes us wonder what a moment, or a movement, or a whole society can demand of one person. And how much is too much? </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Through newly unearthed archival tape, we hear Sipple himself grapple with some of the most vexing topics of his day and ours - privacy, identity, the freedom of the press - not to mention the bonds of family and friendship. </p>\n<p><em>Reported by Latif Nasser and Tracie Hunte.

So today, I want to play for you really one of my favorite stories we've ever done on Radiolab. It's one of those, like, perfect stories where all the different things you want in a story come together all at once. Like, you've got this single human being going through something truly unique and difficult, but inside that single human being story is&mdash;in that kind of universe, in a blade of grass sort of way, is everything. You know, it's that kind of story. Comes from Latif. This is back in the days when Latif was a producer, and this is before he was hosting the show with Lulu Miller and I. It's back in the time when I was hosting the show with Robert Krulwich. So I don't know, let's just let it roll.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT KRULWICH:</strong><span> I'm Robert Krulwich.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>This is Radiolab.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>And today, we are gonna start.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF NASSER:</strong><span> Okay, so let's start ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>With our producer, Latif Nasser.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Well, let's just&mdash;let's just go back to San Francisco on a particular day at a particular time.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And a particular woman.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Hello?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>Hi. Is this Sara Jane?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Yes, it is.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>A woman named ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Sara Jane Moore.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Sara Jane.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So this is San Francisco. The particular date was September 22. The particular time ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>1975.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>It's a Monday morning.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>Was it a nice day?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, yeah. I don't remember anything different, so I assume it was a nice day.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>Okay, all right. Sure, sure.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>I was kind of, you know, in my own head. I remember ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So Sara Jane on this Monday morning, she wakes up early, drops her nine year old off at school, runs a few errands. Then she drives downtown to this&mdash;this big fancy hotel.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>What was the name of the hotel?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>I think it's the St. Francis, isn't it? I'm 87 years old, don't expect me to remember all the details like that. [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>Okay. All right, fair enough.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Uh-huh. But at any rate, you know, I parked in the parking garage across&mdash;right across from the hotel, there's a park, but there's a parking garage underneath. Walked over and walked across the street. There were&mdash;there were sidewalks on both sides of the street. There were people on both sidewalks.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>She joins the crowd across the street from the hotel.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>It was very crowded.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>A couple thousand people. It's like a&mdash;it's like a big scene.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>And there was a barrier, a rope barrier right&mdash;keeping us back on the sidewalk. And my plan had always been to be back in the crowd. You know, and I was dressed like every other middle aged woman that was there. So I ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>What were you&mdash;do you remember what you were wearing? I mean, I'm sure there's ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, there are pictures of it, yes. I was wearing&mdash;I was wearing slacks. That was&mdash;that was at the beginning of when it was natural for women to wear slacks. I had a coat on, and I was carrying a purse. And I went back into the middle of the crowd, as I had planned to do. Anyway, I felt a man come up against me, and socialized as I was in that day and time, I spun around to slap his face.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>She sees this guy there, big strong guy, blonde hair ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Looked at him and realized that it was crowd pressure, that he had not done anything out of&mdash;out of ordinary, that ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>Mm-hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>So I turned back around and went on about my business. I was then pushed up, the crowd pressure was such&mdash;I tried to stay back in the crowd, but I got pushed up almost onto the ropes in the front, right up on the curb of the sidewalk. It's where I had not planned to be. And&mdash;and he apparently was still right behind me, so maybe he was pushed up by the crowd also.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And so Sara Jane is just crammed into this crowd and she's just standing there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Yes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>And were you&mdash;were you nervous?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, nuh-uh. You set out to do something, and I was just going about doing what I had set out to do.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So she waits and she waits. And an hour goes by and two and three, and then finally ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>[drumroll]]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>... out of the hotel comes none other than the President of the United States, Gerald Ford. And he has police and Secret Service. And they're all coming, they're walking out of the hotel.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>To get in his car, which was parked there on the street.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>But he sees the crowd, Sara Jane actually says he looks directly at her, and he waves. He waves to the crowd, and everyone starts applauding and cheering. Now right at that moment, Sara Jane reaches her right hand into her purse ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>And pulled the gun out of my purse.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>A .38 caliber revolver. She cocks it, and then she takes aim right at Gerald Ford's head. And then ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>NEWS CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>[gunshot] Oh my God, there's been a shot! There's been a shot!]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>But Mr. Ford did not fall.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>NEWS CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>We're being pushed back by the police.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>The bullet flies a few feet to the right of Ford, chips the wall behind him. Ford freezes in place. Sara Jane ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>Never planned to take a second shot.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>... now she's just still standing there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SARA JANE MOORE: </em></strong><em><span>With my hand still in the air holding the gun.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Looking over the smoking barrel of the gun.

I don't know why I did it. It was the thing to do at the time.\" And then even after that, he just keeps getting phone calls from reporters.

I don't&mdash;I don't want that in a national paper.\" Daryl says he doesn't remember that. But then right here in this interview, this thing happens where Daryl says ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Daryl Lembke: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, I'll make one more try on the gay thing.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>... \"I'll make one more try on the gay thing.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Daryl Lembke: </em></strong><em><span>You don't&mdash;you don't want to change your mind on that?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>\"You don't want to change your mind on that?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Oliver Sipple:</em></strong><em><span> No, I just don't want to change my mind on that.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, reporter:</em></strong><em><span> May we quote you as saying homosexuality has nothing to do with this?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Oliver Sipple:</em></strong><em><span> You can quote me as saying that if I were a homosexual, I was not&mdash;you can quote me on that.

And Daryl says that when he left that interview, he felt like when it came to Oliver's sexuality ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DARYL LEMBKE:</em></strong><em><span> He didn't want to be quoted.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>That was it. Like. just don't quote me on it. But still ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DARYL LEMBKE:</em></strong><em><span> I was trying to report from all sides about it. The big side for me was that he was a hero and the President of the United States was very slow on the take in thanking him for saving his life.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And Daryl thought that Oliver's sexuality, the fact that he was gay, might have something to do with that. Because just seven months earlier ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>NEWS CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>On March 6, Sergeant Leonard Matlovich disclosed to a supervising officer at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia that he was a homosexual and wanted to stay in the Air Force.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>This Air Force sergeant named Leonard Matlovich, who had the purple heart, had the bronze star, he comes out that he's gay and he's kicked out of the Air Force.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Leonard Matlovich:</em></strong><em><span> In conversations, you hear people say that you know we're discharging this queer, that queer, throwing them out of the Air Force.

And never really can have the protection of my fellow minority group, and&mdash;and just keeping quiet. And my consciousness wouldn't let me do it anymore. I had to come forward and say, \"No more, America.\"]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And now you've got this former Marine, saved a president's life and it's two days later, he still hasn't heard from the president.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DARYL LEMBKE:</em></strong><em><span> So that's when I knew ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So for Daryl, even though Oliver had said, \"Don't make this about my sexuality ...\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DARYL LEMBKE:</em></strong><em><span> I still thought it was a national story, and it was pretty hard to ignore it after Herb Caen had started the ball rolling.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So that night after the interview, Daryl calls in his story to the LA Times office, and he uses this phrase. He says that Oliver is a former Marine who was quote, \"A prominent figure in the gay community.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DARYL LEMBKE:</em></strong><em><span> Put it down aways in the story, but the rewrite guy put it in the lede.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Really?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DARYL LEMBKE:</em></strong><em><span> And it made it the big thing.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And so, three days after the assassination attempt, the LA Times runs a story with the headline, \"No Call From President, Hero in Ford Shooting Active Among SF Gays.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DARYL LEMBKE:</em></strong><em><span> And the LA Times had a news service.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And so Daryl's story, it goes&mdash;I mean, it goes everywhere.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>NEWS CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>In another strange twist to the story ...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Headlines are like, \"Gay Vet,\" or \"Homosexual Hero.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>NEWS CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>It's been reported that the ex-Marine who deflected Mrs. Moore's shot on Monday is well known in San Francisco's gay activist circles.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And so it was not just running in Los Angeles, it's also running in Chicago, it's running in Dallas, it's running in Indianapolis, and it's running, you know, of all places, in Oliver Sipple's hometown. In Detroit.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>I guess what I'm wondering is if you have a guy who says, \"Please don't talk about this.

What did he say? And if you can remember.\" \"I was on afternoons then, and I had seen him because I had come in early.

Thank you for taking the time to write to me. In view of some of the events since the unfortunate attempt on your life on Monday, September 22, I really appreciate your publicly thanking me. As you probably know, there have been a number of stories concerning my personal sexual orientation in the news media. These stories have caused great anguish to my parents and to the rest of my family, I am sure. My mother hung up on me when I first called her after these stories began to be published. I know you are concerned with very many matters which are too important and pressing for you to be concerned with the details of my private life, however, the unexpected and glaring publicity, which has been given to my private life has very seriously disrupted my family relationships. Mr. President, it is a very hard thing to have your mother and family not want to have any contact with you. I know that your schedule is heavily occupied, but I respectfully request that you take the time to see my family or at least call my family. The telephone number is 313 [fades out]. I love my family, and I do not want to be separated from their love and companionship. Your help will be gratefully appreciated. Respectfully, Oliver W. Sipple.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GEORGE SIPPLE JR.:</em></strong><em><span> Wow! That's sad.

The archivists at the Ford Library, they went through his call logs and there was no evidence that he ever made that call. And then we talked to George Jr., and he talked to everybody in his family and they don't remember it either. Anyway, you can't say for sure, but as far as we can tell, that call never happened. But we did find out that the same day that Oliver sent that letter back to Ford, he and his lawyer filed a $15 million lawsuit against the press.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Really? Saying what?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>That the newspapers, when they publicized that he was gay without his consent, they violated his privacy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JOEY PLASTER: </em></strong><em><span>Okay, walking out of Civic Center BART onto Civic Center in San Francisco.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>It's just&mdash;it's one of these cases where it pulls your head in one direction and it pulls your heart in the exact opposite direction, and so we wanted to get into the legal case files.

Sipple. Let's see ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So one of the arguments that the lawyers for the newspapers were making is that Oliver's sexuality was not actually private.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JOEY PLASTER: </em></strong><em><span>Lawyer: Were there any people that you knew in San Francisco in, say, September, 1975 who knew that you were homosexual? Sipple: Yes. Lawyer: Approximately how many people? Sipple: I have no idea. Lawyer: More than 10? Sipple: Yes. Lawyer: More than 50? Sipple: Yes. Lawyer: More than 100? Sipple: Yes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>There were people in New York who knew he was gay, there were people in Dallas who knew he was gay, and it kind of&mdash;they settle in the&mdash;like, in the hundreds.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JOEY PLASTER: </em></strong><em><span>Lawyer: Did you tell anybody before September of 1975 that you were a homosexual? Sipple: If I were asked. Lawyer: I am asking you. Sipple: I don't know what you are asking.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And they make the argument, the newspapers' lawyers, that hey, this was already somewhat public a fact.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DAN MORAIN: </em></strong><em><span>But his personal business was his personal business.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JOEY PLASTER: </em></strong><em><span>\"I have never attempted to obtain publicity for the fact that I am gay or predominantly homosexual in my sexual orientation.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DAN MORAIN: </em></strong><em><span>He was a private citizen.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JOEY PLASTER: </em></strong><em><span>\"I have made my home approximately 1,800 miles away from home of my parents and my family so that I could move somewhat freely in the gay community without the fact of my sexual orientation getting back to my parents or family.\" And it goes on.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>But the newspapers made this other argument that was like, okay, whether or not you're living a double life, whether or not you wanted to or whether or not you had to, there's something here that's bigger than that, that's bigger than you.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DAN MORAIN: </em></strong><em><span>Which was he was a private citizen who thrust himself&mdash;as anybody would hope they would do. He ran&mdash;he went toward danger, and when he did, he also thrust himself into the public eye.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And to journalists, when you're in the public eye you become something else entirely. You become a public figure.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>NEWS CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Yesterday in San Francisco a shot fired ...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>When that happened to Oliver ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DAN MORAIN: </em></strong><em><span>He lost his right to privacy.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Daryl Lembke: </em></strong><em><span>I'll make one more try on the gay thing.

That they're heroes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JOEY PLASTER: </em></strong><em><span>An image certainly contrary to the stereotype of persons associated with the gay community as weak and unheroic figures.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Which is to say this is newsworthy, this is worth knowing, and it is something that the whole country wants to know. And the value of that is more than the value of this individual person's privacy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Did they make it that explicitly? I mean, sort of putting it in terms of the public benefit outweighs the private privacy?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So Oliver's case, it dragged on for nine years, so from 1975 to 1984. But this is&mdash;I'm quoting the judgment, \"The record shows that the publications were not motivated by morbid and sensational prying into appellant's private life, but rather were prompted by legitimate political concerns, i.e. to dispel the false public opinion that gays were timid, weak and unheroic figures, and to raise the equally important political question whether the President of the United States entertained a discriminatory attitude or bias against a minority group such as homosexuals.\" So the court tossed Oliver's case out. He lost. He didn't get a dime.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I mean, if you think about it, it is weird that a journalist can just take a person's most private details, and then if it feels relevant, like, if they can make that argument, they can just put it out there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>It is the job&mdash;like, if we were to go silent because somebody says, \"Don't say that about me,\" then&mdash;and the government backs him up ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>But if it's meaningful, then the person, out of which the meaning is being pulled painfully has nothing to say about it? That's just weird to me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>It's really hard.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL LUZER: </em></strong><em><span>I mean, I was thinking about this like even sort of on the train coming over here.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Again, Daniel Luzer.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL LUZER: </em></strong><em><span>And it's like the thing that, like, makes journalism law so complicated, and the things that make an invasion of privacy discussion so difficult is that, like, what makes something not an invasion of privacy is not that it's okay, it's that it's politically, you know, relevant. So, like, the fact that the story&mdash;the fact that the private details of his life are politically relevant means that it's not an invasion of privacy. You know, it doesn't mean that it isn't rude or that it doesn't hurt. It means that it's an appropriate story to&mdash;you know, to publish.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>But I do think, like, why should the journalists be the only ones to decide what is newsworthy? It's not&mdash;like why is it that then journalists, you just pick up a notepad and a pencil and, all the sudden, you have so much more power to say what's sayable than anybody else?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL LUZER: </em></strong><em><span>Well I mean, we have this sort of long tradition of that in the United States. I mean, like, that's what the First Amendment is. I mean, I don't know. I mean it's like yeah sure, why do journalists get to decide that? Well, like, who would you rather have decide it? It's not a perfect system, but it's&mdash;you know&mdash;it kind of works.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TRACIE HUNTE:</em></strong><em><span> So is Oliver just like this ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>This is producer Tracie Hunte, who was in on the interview.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TRACIE: </em></strong><em><span>Somebody whose life is basically kind of sacrificed to the altar of the First Amendment in, like, this sad way?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL LUZER: </em></strong><em><span>Yes. Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, it feels like he was sacrificed from all sides, actually.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah. It feels like there's this one kind of man in the middle, and then there are all these forces around him, these&mdash;like, larger-than-life forces, like the White House, there's the gay movement, there's the freedom of the press. And all these people are sort of batting around all these&mdash;all these enormous and important abstractions, and then in the middle of it, there's this guy that just is trampled by all of them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And so what ends up happening to him in the end?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Well apparently, some people in the gay community&mdash;during and after the lawsuit&mdash;felt that he was trying to go back in the closet, so they sort of turned their backs on him. He&mdash;surprisingly, he was friends with Harvey Milk, 'til the end. Like, when Harvey Milk was assassinated, Oliver Sipple went to his funeral. And he did have one brother, George Sr. who stuck by him throughout, but his parents did not. And they never fully accepted the fact that he was gay. And when his mom died, it was so bad that Oliver Sipple's father didn't let him go to the funeral. And because he sort of&mdash;he had so few people, I guess, at the end and because there weren't, you know, a lot news articles about him, and because a lot of people in the gay community from that time have died because of the AIDS crisis, it was really hard to find out what happened to Oliver Sipple in those last five years of his life. And the only way we could was because when we were talking to Daniel Luzer, he mentioned this interview that he did with this guy named Wayne Friday. He was friend of Oliver's.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL LUZER: </em></strong><em><span>Wayne Friday was sort of like a pillar of the community in San Francisco, like a pillar of the gay community, and then also a sort of political figure. And he was a cop and he was sort of fingers in every pie kind of thing.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Wayne died last year, but Daniel still had the transcript of their conversation about Oliver Sipple's last days. And so ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GORDON PINSENT: </em></strong><em><span>If you guys need time to absorb or just think about for a second, that's fine with me.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>... we found an actor, the very gifted Gordon Pinsent, and we had him read it for us.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GORDON PINSENT: </em></strong><em><span>Okay, let me have a go. \"Uh, I forget. Was it 1975, the Sara Jane Moore, or&mdash;yeah, then I met him around '73. He was a swamper at a gay bar called The Cockpit. Swamper, they used to clean the bars at night. You know, they'd set the bar up for the next bartender in the morning, that's what he did. He did it at two or three different bars. He was always at the bars. I'd see him. We actually became friends because we discovered we were both from Michigan. Bill was a good guy, he was just a fucking alcoholic. I mean, he'd get his disability check once a month, and he'd go down&mdash;one of the bars in the Tenderloin where he used to hang out was called Queen Mary's Pub. He'd go in there the day he got his check. I swear to God, he'd spend his whole fucking check on everybody. And he'd get broke the rest of the month. He just couldn't control himself. And he was a little bit of a blowhard, you know? He'd get drunk and loud and he'd get tossed out of bars. I used to drive him home. He had an apartment on Van Ness, had a little studio, maybe a one bedroom on the first floor at about Turk. He'd be drunker than hell at the bar and I'd drive him home, so I always knew where he lived.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GORDON PINSENT: </em></strong><em><span>\"And after this thing with Ford, it really fucked his mind up. Sipple was a broken guy after that. The whole thing worked him. The publicity of it all, and the fact that everyone knew he was a faggot, you know? He said to me a couple times, 'I went to the Marine Corps and I got hurt. And now what I am known for? For being a faggot!' And I'd say, 'No, you're not. You're known for saving the President's life. You won't be known for what you did in bed, for Christ's sake.' But he would get drunk and he'd start bemoaning that. I'd sit there in the bar with him, and I'd talk to him about it. 'Hey, man. It is what it is.' But he was just&mdash;he was just&mdash;down to nothing. This thing happened, and it overcame him. It was too much for him to handle. And I think he got to feeling sorry for himself, and his family. Just many a night, I would sit in the bar with Bill Sipple, and he'd cry on your shoulder, and you'd say, 'Okay, Sipple, it's time to go home.' And then I'd drive him home.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GORDON PINSENT: </em></strong><em><span>\"I remember it was raining. It was pouring fucking rain. Bruce called me at my office over at the DA's office and said, 'Wayne, will you do a well-being check on Sipple for me?' And I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Nobody's seen the dude. He hasn't been around for a while.' So we go out there together, and it was raining. And I'm ringing the bell, ringing the bell, ring. He doesn't answer. I notice on his door there were these little stick 'em things, post-its. And he had befriended this little old lady who lived next door&mdash;they kind of looked after each other. And she'd left all these little notes. 'Bill, call me. I can't get ahold of you.' So I rang the manager's bell, and it was a little Filipino guy. I showed him my badge and I said, 'You gotta let me in.' And so he did. And the door opened, and I knew what was going on. It's the smell. It's the smell you never forget. It's a sickening, sweet smell. Bill was sitting in the chair. He was bloated. He was bloated out real big. He had a bottle of Jack Daniels sitting there, and the television was still on. The coroner told me he'd been dead about 10 days, as near as they could figure. God, I didn't know he was only 47. I thought he was older than that. Anyway. I got the guy to open the door for me. And the minute he did, I said, 'Close it!' And then I had to stand there and wait for the coroner.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GORDON PINSENT: </em></strong><em><span>\"I remember it was over here at the Campbell Funeral Home on Market Street. And then we buried him out in Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno. And I remember it was&mdash;it was very small. The casket wasn't open. The funeral was just&mdash;I mean, there were more media there than anything else. I've seen him buy drinks for more people than were at that funeral. He could have been buried in Arlington if they'd made an issue out of it. I mean, shit, there he was, this national icon, a gay whatever, and there were just a few people out there for the funeral.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Oliver Sipple:</em></strong><em><span> I believe in human life, and I think that this country stands for human values, including life and freedom.

But you couldn't look at every phone book.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>STEVEN LEVY: </em></strong><em><span>I eventually figured one place I might go is the American Medical Association.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Figures this guy Harvey is a doctor, maybe they have his contact info.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>STEVEN LEVY: </em></strong><em><span>So I called them up. You know, I said, \"I&rsquo;m really trying to find this Dr. Thomas Harvey. Thomas S. Harvey.\" I knew his middle name. And this very kindly woman, you know, looked up stuff, and then told me there is a Thomas S. Harvey in Wichita, Kansas.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>So he calls directory assistance in Wichita, and says, \"Do you guys have a number for a Thomas Harvey?\" They said yes. He asks, \"Is that number listed?\" And they said yes.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>STEVEN LEVY: </em></strong><em><span>And they gave me his phone number. And I took a deep breath and dialed the phone number. Back then, if someone wasn&rsquo;t there, it would just ring and ring and you&rsquo;d hang up and that would be it. Because it's pre-answering machine. But he picked up the phone. And I said, \"Is this Dr. Harvey?\" And he said yes. And I said, \"Is this the Dr. Harvey who worked at Princeton Hospital in 1955?\" And there was this pause. Like, I figured, this is sort of yes or no question, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>[laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>STEVEN LEVY: </em></strong><em><span>There was a pause. Like, he was almost debating whether to own up to this. And finally he said yes. In retrospect, maybe it was a little of the jig is up. And he said, \"Well, I don't know if I could help you.\" And I said, \"Well, I&rsquo;d just like to talk to you.\" He said, \"Well --\" and he, you know, was sort of not saying yes or no. And I said, \"You know what? I'm coming out there to talk to you.\" So I booked a ticket for Wichita, Kansas.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Steve hops on a plane to Kansas. He spends the night. And then the next morning he wakes up, gets a cab and goes over to Harvey's lab.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>STEVEN LEVY: </em></strong><em><span>I rang the bell or whatever, and Dr. Harvey came to open the door for me.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>What did he look like?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>STEVEN LEVY: </em></strong><em><span>He looked like, you know, the guy who would be your pediatrician. You know, this kindly-looking guy in his sixties, I guess. He's wearing a lab coat, and I remember very clearly he had in his pocket one of those pens that could write in three colors, you know, red, green, blue? And he took me back to the back of the facility to his office which was basically a glassed-in cubicle. And with a desk and a chair, some shelves, and some cardboard boxes behind the chair. And I sat down and we talked.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Now at this point, Harvey hadn&rsquo;t admitted to anything. But Steve had a feeling, a definite feeling.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>STEVEN LEVY: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, you could tell he's very cautious, very guarded. You know, and I'm asking every way to try to figure out where the brain is. And I asked him a few times, you know, \"Where's the brain?\" And he really didn't want to answer that. And then finally, I just said, \"Well, don&rsquo;t you even have any pictures of it?\" And then he sort of broke down when I asked, you know, maybe because he sensed I was so frustrated. Because, you know, I was saying, \"No pictures, even?\" And he just sort of, like, sagged a little. So he gets up and he walks behind me and there was sort of like a beer cooler near where he was. And I&rsquo;m thinking, \"It's in the beer cooler? No!\" He keeps walking past there, and he goes behind me to where one of the cardboard boxes is.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>And he pulls out these two jars.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>STEVEN LEVY: </em></strong><em><span>And in one of the jars there are these pieces of biomass floating in there. They&rsquo;re clearly brain stuff. And I'm, like, staring at this thing. And I'm, like, thunderstruck. I mean, it was like a jolt, you know? This was amazing. I mean, you know, you could hear the chorus of angels singing, \"Ahh, Einstein's brain!\" I'm taking this in and I'm like, \"This is the brain that changed the world.\" And to see that brain was a moving experience, actually.

A mass of protoplasm could do that?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>So she did these studies on rats which became very famous, where she figured out that if you put a rat in an enriched environment, so a cage with a lot of toys, things to climb around on and lots of other rat friends to hang out with, instead of just putting them in the boring old normal cage, what you'll find is that their brains actually change. They'll have more of these little cells called glial cells, which for a long time people thought glial cells were just, like, the scaffolding of the brain.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Like, neurons were where the action was. That's where all the thinking happened. And glial cells were just like, you know, the studs and mortar of the house, just kind of holding everything together. But around this time when Marian Diamond was doing these studies, they were starting to realize that the glial cells also had neurotransmitters flowing through them. Like, that they might be more important than we thought. But shortly after she publishes her rat studies, she hears about Harvey.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>CAROLYN ABRAHAM: </em></strong><em><span>She saw, you know, a little piece about it in the journal Science, and so she started to track down Harvey and she called him.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>And in 1984, Harvey sends her four chunks of brain.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>CAROLYN ABRAHAM: </em></strong><em><span>She went looking in Einstein&rsquo;s brain to see if there was, you know, something similar to what she had been recording in her animal experiments.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>And she finds that compared to the average brain, Einstein had a lot of glial cells.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>What's -- what's a lot? Like, twice as many?

And on top of that, after she published this research, some other scientists raised questions that maybe the experimental methods weren't valid. So ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm. Not convinced.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Yeah, me neither.

And his whole thing, he studied five other adult male dead brains.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>He looked at their pre-frontal cortexes, and that's, like, where higher cognitive abilities are located. So, like, if you were gonna take a test, that's the part of your brain that's gonna be activated.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Uh-huh.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And he found that compared to the other brains that he had, the neurons in Einstein's brain were more tightly-packed there.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Huh. So his neurons were more tightly-packed in a certain part of his brain.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Did he have more neurons at that part, or less neurons?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Same number, roughly.

He dismisses himself in a way. He found a difference, but he also was quick to say, like, we just have one of these brains.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>CAROLYN ABRAHAM: </em></strong><em><span>He said listen, you know, this was always gonna be an N of 1 in any experiment.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>He's kind of like the middle child of all these researchers.

So years before, she had gotten this group together. Basically, like, they signed up, they'd, like, took IQ tests. They did all these things while they were still alive.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>She knew their health history.

And she writes this article.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>And the gist of the article was that he had unusual parietal lobes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>Unusual parietal lobes?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>The parietal lobes of Einstein's brain were anatomically exceptional, if you will.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Where is the parietal lobes again?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>It's kind of like where your baseball cap is, like, mainly ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Isn't it sort of like top of your head, but back?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Or if you had a ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Yes, exactly.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>A yarmulke.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Yes.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And this area of your brain, this is where all of your sensory information comes in. And because of that, it's also where your visual-spatial awareness is located. So like the way that you orient yourself in the world is mostly located in that part of your brain. Like, if you close your eyes and you think, \"Where are my hands? Where my knees? Where are my feet?\" Well, you have an internal mental map that's telling you where those things are. And that's your parietal lobe doing that. Anyhow, so what was different about this part of Einstein's brain is that if you imagine the brain to look like a walnut, which is kind of the only way I imagine the brain, there are, like, all these grooves and crevices. And there's this one groove, like a groovy groove, like a deeper crevice called the Sylvian Fissure. In Einstein's brain it was shorter than the rest of ours. And apparently that's very strange.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>CAROLYN ABRAHAM: </em></strong><em><span>When she described it to me, she said it was, you know, to see this unique pattern in Einstein's brain was as striking as seeing a face with the eyebrows beneath the eyes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Huh.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And Sandra Witelson proposed that maybe because this crevice was a little bit shorter, the electricity in this part of his brain could go much more quickly.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh, because it wouldn't have to travel around the ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Yeah, it didn't have to take a detour over a ditch. It could just go pkew!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Mm-hmm. So this was her -- this was her speculation?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>This was her speculation. Yes. And so she was saying, like, the parietal lobe, like, this is where his genius might be. And if you think about Einstein, like everybody says, like, one of his greatest talents is, like, the way that he could manipulate shapes in his mind. And then, like, orient objects in his head.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>I mean, just the idea that space-time is curved, you know? So he has this kind of great visual-spatial sense. And if you had to pick a part of your brain that could underlie mathematical abilities or visual-spatial abilities, that's parietal lobes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>When I was looking up these papers, you see Thomas Harvey's name as, like, the co-author.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Oh, he was a co-author?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Yeah. He's, like, cited in the paper. And it just made my heart happy, like he made it! He got it! Especially for Sandra Witelson, because he all these years had been, like, shepherding this forward. And when that paper came out ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>CAROLYN ABRAHAM: </em></strong><em><span>I think Tom Harvey felt then that -- that his work was over.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Because he felt at that point that they had pointed to something that was real.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Yes.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And true.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>He felt like finally the work that he promised to do in the very beginning was finally done. And at that point ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>CAROLYN ABRAHAM: </em></strong><em><span>He actually decided to give the brain back to Princeton Hospital in the care of Elliot Krauss.

I'm happy for Mr. Harvey, but in terms of the science, maybe you convinced me a little bit, like a medium bit, but it still kind of smells like phrenology to me. I mean, it's like, listening to it, the experience that I have is like, \"Ooh! A Sylvian Fissure! His was smaller!\"</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And then I think to myself, what the fuck is a Sylvian Fissure? I don't even know what that is.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And like the fact that, like, we so clearly default to this fascination with a thing that I don't -- I can't even explain, it just kind of seems absurd.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>And we know that he said that, like, he didn't think he was a particularly special guy. Like, he said various -- there's lots of quotes from him where he talks about saying, like, I was just in the right place at the right time. Or ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>He does say that. Really?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Yeah. Or, you know, when he's talking about his fame, he has some quote about worrying that the packaging of him is better than the meat inside, or something. Like he's a sausage. I mean, this is part of the myth of him, is like -- I mean, he was very humble.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>There's another one where he talks about, like -- he sometimes talks about what made him special was his stubbornness, that he was really obstinate and he wouldn't let things go. That's one of the only things I feel like you hear him talking about as some innate characteristic of him that made him different than other people. But he never talks about being smart. He never talks about his brain. I mean, I haven't read every Einstein quote, but I feel like we've been swimming around in it for a while the last few months, and I haven't seen him say anything about his brain, ever.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>It is interesting that he says he's -- he was in the right place at the right time.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Which can sound kind of like humble, but also maybe it's like if you take it seriously, maybe there is something to it.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Yeah. I mean, we've been talking about the neural connections inside his head, but you can also think about it a little more broadly. Like about the connections outside his head. Almost as if the neurons didn't stop inside his skull, but, like, continued outward into the world around him.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>And that's what we're gonna do after a quick break.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>MADELEINE: </em></strong><em><span>Hi, this is Madeleine calling from Berlin, Germany.

What were you thinking of when you said that?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Yeah, I mean a lot of -- there's sort of the obvious things that must be said. Einstein was building on the work of lots of other physicists like Poincare and Lorentz who had been chipping away at these same questions that puzzled him. So there's that. But if you widen the lens a little bit and you start to think more broadly, you start to see some really interesting kind of bigger forces that were at work on Einstein when he was coming up with these ideas. Like, just take Special Relativity which most people would say is one of his most revolutionary ideas.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And Special Relativity is?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Special Relativity to put it, like, very basically is the idea that time is relative and that times slows down as you go faster. So if you're going a million miles an hour versus 10 miles an hour, time will literally slow down for you. It won't just seem slower, it will actually be slower.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I feel like this is the moment when science and common sense just parted ways.

Like, outside ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER GALLISON: </em></strong><em><span>This was a transformative moment in the technological history of the world.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PAT: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, what were some of the big, like, hot inventions happening?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER GALLISON: </em></strong><em><span>Well, if you looked out the window of any Central European or Western European city, you would see new kinds of trams being installed, electric motors. You would see networks of clocks that were established. You would see all sorts -- new devices that were being invented that could send signals, the extension of the telegraph network. Everything in motion, everything in change. And ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>As a consequence, he says ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER GALLISON: </em></strong><em><span>Time is -- has suddenly become a topic of immense interest.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Not just because the world seemed to be moving faster, but because for the first time in human history, you could be in several different times at once.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER GALLISON: </em></strong><em><span>As you ran trains, say you leave Chicago at 3 p.m., when you get to a distant city, what time is it there? Do you use the time that you started with in Chicago? Do you use the time that you're arriving at in Philadelphia? Who sets -- what are the times?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>You know, before the railroad, time was local. Every town had its own time.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER GALLISON: </em></strong><em><span>Set in each town by the local jeweler who repaired and made clocks and watches.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>But then with the railroad you needed a central time. And there were literally skirmishes over whose time would become </span><em><span>the</span></em><span> time. We actually did a show about this, like a million years ago.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER GALLISON: </em></strong><em><span>It was a big, big struggle. There were people who didn't like that at all. But suddenly the ability to traverse at a fairly high speed, hundreds even thousands of miles, created the demand to think about what time was and how to coordinate it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>So that was sort of the mood of the moment. Like, just outside the window of the patent office where Einstein was sitting there thinking big thoughts. And one of the specific questions he was wrestling with was the one Peter just threw out. Like, how would you coordinate two different clocks in two different cities? A lot of people at the time thought the way you do it is you send an electrical signal, like through a telegraph wire from one clock to the other, calculate the amount of time it would take that signal to get from the first clock to the second clock, then you take that miniscule amount of time and subtract it from one of the clocks or add it to one of the clocks, and then you'd have the same time in two places. And that sort of solved the problem. But then the next thought Einstein had was what if that signal you were using was traveling at the speed of light? And what if those two clocks -- like, what if one of them was moving? And if it was moving and the light was sort of chasing it, wouldn't it take the light longer to get there? And wouldn't that, like, screw up your whole ability to coordinate time? Why am I telling you this? Because these kinds of questions, they sort of infiltrated Einstein's dreams.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>Einstein wrote about this in his autobiography, so we have a very good idea.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>That's Jimena Canales.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>I'm a historian of science.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>At the University of Illinois. And she says Einstein wrote about these very particular daydreams he had.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>He said that he imagined himself being propelled through space chasing after a light beam. And that, historians of science, biographers of Einstein often agree that it was that sort of experiment of seeing, you know, what actually happens if I pursue a light beam that had the -- provided the origin of his thought of the Theory of Relativity.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>And I'll explain why that light beam was such a big deal in a minute, but the main thing Jimena wanted to tell me about it was that it often gets explained as something that just emerged from Einstein's brain. Like, that was purely an original idea of his.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>But it was not his idea at all.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>According to Jimena, a story he read sort of led him to it. She says Einstein loved science fiction as a kid.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>And he said he was particularly taken by one author. The name is Aaron Bernstein, who wrote quite a few volumes. And Einstein says that he read them with quote \"breathless attention.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>And Jimena says the story that got Einstein thinking about chasing light beams was about ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>A faster-than-light traveler, and what happens if we travel faster than the speed of light.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>The story sort of imagines that you could have a guy who shoots off into space and perches himself on a star, where he looks back at Earth. And what he sees isn't the same Earth he left.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>But a different world, a different universe.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>But an earlier Earth. Because, as Bernstein explains, when we look out at anything in space, we're not seeing it exactly as it is, but rather as it was.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>For example, when you look at the sun, you're really seeing the sun eight minutes in the past, because the light waves take time to -- to reach you.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>And because this traveler could travel faster than light ...</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>All you needed to do, you know, if you wanted to look at the Earth eight minutes in the past, all you needed to do was to go to the sun. And if you jump into farther and farther planets and stars, then you can choose whatever time in history you want to see.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>So in this story, this traveler could bounce from that first star to a planet to another star and another and another.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>Quote, \"In one point in space, the light of the scenes of the French Revolution is just coming into view. And even farther away, the invasion of the barbarians has just become the order of the day. Alexander The Great is still conquering the world. Historical events that have long been dead for us will just be coming to life.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>By the way, this was one of the first time travel stories in history, which is crazy to think about. 3,000 years of human writings and almost nobody to that point had imagined someone going back in time or going into the future. These stories that today are so much a part of movies and culture, they all basically started at the time Einstein was growing up. He just happened to be alive at that time. And Jimena says they opened his mind.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JIMENA CANALES: </em></strong><em><span>And he said that these stories really prompted him to imagine himself being propelled through space chasing after a light beam.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>And the reason that mental image was so pivotal for Einstein was that right around the time it popped into his head, other physicists were noticing this weird thing about the speed of light. Unlike everything else in the known world, light always moved at the same speed, no matter how fast you were moving relative to it. And in picturing himself riding along beside this light beam, Einstein realized that if light always moved at the same speed, if light was constant then time must be relative. Which sort of, you know, eventually would turn our understanding of the universe upside down.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So you're saying that if he hadn't been alive at a time where there are railroads which created time problems, all the while there are people writing time travel fiction for the first time in history, all that hadn't been happening he might not have thought the thoughts that he thunk.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Yeah. Yeah, like I -- I still think there was something about his brain that explains part of it.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>But all this other stuff, the time travel, the railroads, the stories, I would say that that adds, like, another 25 percent.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So the brain is what, like a 20?</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Yeah, give the brain maybe 20.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I would say 12, but that's okay. Let's go with 20. 20 plus 25, sort of like roughly half. I don't know. A half. Let's say it's a half.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Yeah, I like halfway there.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>This precise math that we're doing.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>I'm gonna see if I can push us a little bit further.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay.

Because everything you experience, rewrites your biology, it etches yourself into you. And so when you look at a brain, you're not just looking at a structure. You are, according to Brian, in some fundamental way looking at the life that person lived.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, every genius thought, every deep insight, every pattern recognized, happened inside that gloppy, gray, three or four pound structure. That's all there is.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>Whatever set him apart, Brian says, is in there. Somewhere.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BRIAN GREENE: </em></strong><em><span>And if we had the capacity to lay out every single circuit and every single influence that could cascade through that brain, if we were able to fully understand all the electrical signals and crackles that would go through that brain, yes, I believe that we would fully understand Einstein's process, and understand how it was that he was able to do what he did. We can't do that. Yet.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>Well, there's a lot of interest in this concept that the structure of the brain is gonna tell you something about the function.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>That's neurologist Fred Lepore, who we heard from earlier. And he says people are trying, not so much with Einstein's brain anymore. But he says there's this whole exploding area of neuroscience where researchers are trying to describe the brain at the level of detail Brian's describing.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>That's funded to the tune of $4.5-billion.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>He told us about one guy who's doing this, just about a mile from where Einstein lived.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>There's a Princeton University professor, Sebastian Seung, and what he does is he takes a cubic millimeter -- a cubic millimeter of mouse retina. That's neural tissue, it's not brain. But it's neural tissue.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PAT: </em></strong><em><span>Mm-hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>And he slices this into these vanishingly-thin sections and then he tries to trace the axons, the dendrites, the neurons, the astrocytes, the oligodendroglia, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. It can take months -- it can take months to do a cubic millimeter. And then you gotta have some kind of software that can analyze to see if the structure can lead you to some kind of conclusion about circuitry.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PAT: </em></strong><em><span>Right.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>Which might get you to function. Might get you to function.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PAT: </em></strong><em><span>Like, why not definitely? Like, if that doesn't get you to function, then what would? What would be -- what would be left out if we could map perfectly the structure of all the connections?</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>Well, you're talking like me. You're talking like a -- see, I'm by default, I'm a neurologist, I'm a materialist. They call me a materialist because I'm saying, \"Well, the left side of the brain has something to do with the right arm and speech.\" That's -- that's called materialism. But there's another school of thought and that's called dualism.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PAT: </em></strong><em><span>Uh-huh.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>Which is somehow mind, consciousness, spirit, soul, you pick out the noun you want there, is separate from the physical substrate of the brain.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PAT: </em></strong><em><span>Huh. How would that be science, though? Because I mean, I can imagine a school of thought which allows for that, but it feels like you're very quickly stepping out of science if you go that way.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>FRED LEPORE: </em></strong><em><span>Well, yes. Yes. Okay. Probably, you know, see we're all brought up on this thing, when you read anything in the popular press about the brain, they'll show you functional neuroimaging. So when someone talks, the Broca's area, the speech area on the left side of the brain lights up. And you go, \"Well, there's your answer! That's the structure, it lights up. That's what's creating language.\" Except when you deal with the neurophilosophers they say, \"Well, we got one problem with that.\" It's called the hard problem. If you look at that chunk of brain that you're calling Broca's area that lights up when you talk, what exactly is happening there? How does that create -- how does that create a word? Or if you're looking at the occipital lobe and you're looking at the color red, how do you create that qualia, which is a fancy way of saying the sensation of color. We can show you where it is happening, we just can't show you how. We're all looking at the same thing. We're saying somehow if we could get a better handle on the anatomy, maybe we can explain a thought. But we can't explain a thought. I mean, forget -- forget relativity. We can't explain a thought yet.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVAL CLIP, EINSTEIN:</em></strong><em><span> &ldquo;It follows from the special theory of relativity that mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same thing, a somewhat unfamiliar conception for the average mind.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PAT: </strong><span>This episode was reported by Rachael Cusick and me, and produced by Bethel Habte, Rachael and me and Jad Abumrad.
