                "body": "<p>Fantasy writer Elsa Sjunneson has been haunted by Helen Keller for nearly her entire life. Like Helen, Elsa is Deafblind, and growing up she was constantly compared to her. But for a million different reasons she hated that, because she felt different from her in a million different ways. Then, a year ago, an online conspiracy theory claiming Helen was a fraud exploded on TikTok, and suddenly Elsa found herself drawing her sword and jumping to Helen\u2019s defense, setting off a chain of events that would bring her closer to the disability icon than she ever dreamt. For over a year, Elsa, Lulu and the Radiolab team dug through primary sources, talked to experts, even visited Helen\u2019s birthplace Ivy Green, and discovered the real story of Helen Keller is far more complicated, mysterious and confounding than the simple myth of a young Deafblind girl rescued by her teacher Annie Sullivan. It\u2019s a story of ghosts, surprises, a few tears, a bit of romance, some hard conversations, and a possibly psychic dog.<strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><em><span>This episode was reported by Elsa Sjunneson and Lulu Miller.

So&mdash;are you&mdash;well, she was a real lady.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She was definitely a real lady, but the TikTokers were questioning that story we all know about her. You know, the story that she was both deaf and blind.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Uh-huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Totally cut off from the world. Until this lady, the quote-unquote \"miracle worker,\" Anne Sullivan, showed up, and then using a technique called finger spelling, taught her language culminating in this dramatic moment by a water pump where Helen Keller finally understood the word \"water,\" and then went on to write a dozen books, tons of articles and travel the world.

Elsa ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I was born partially deaf and partially blind.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>... herself is Deafblind.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She has Bluetooth-enabled hearing aids and glasses and reads using a magnifier. That's how she's able to tweet and talk with us today.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Got it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And so her tweet promptly goes viral.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Uh-huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So then Elsa's kind of watching, like, thousands of likes and reshares. She's suddenly realizing she has thrust herself into the limelight as Helen Keller's bodyguard and defender.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah. Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Which is &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Oh God. Oh no.

And she's come to see that it's not just her life but all of our lives, our brains that are haunted by Helen Keller in a pretty surprising and insidious way.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music fades out with echo]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So allow me to just take you back where the haunting all began for Elsa.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah!</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay, so we're going to the mid-'90's Seattle. Nirvana's on the air. Elsa, little Elsa is on the&mdash;she's on the floor in her third grade classroom.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Sitting next to her classmates.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I had giant coke bottle glasses. Like, the 1990s were not kind to low-vision children.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And her teacher pulls out a picture book about Helen Keller.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I distinctly remember seeing the illustration that sort of everybody sees, which is where she's standing there with her hand underneath the faucet at the pump, signing the word \"water\" into Annie Sullivan's hand. And, like, I just sort of remember being like, \"Well, I know I can't see and I can't really hear that well but, like, this isn't me.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She said she knew, of course, that she had some trouble seeing.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I ran into things a lot [laughs].</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And some trouble hearing, which became particularly apparent during verbal spelling tests.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>The words that I was hearing my classmates say weren't the words that I was supposed to be writing down.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Oh, so like, they'd say, \"Fly,\" and you'd spell \"Thigh\" or something.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: light, ethereal tones floating in space]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But whenever someone would compare her to Helen Keller, which she said happened a lot ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>It was always, \"But I'm not like that.\" And I think that's because I was always told, like, \"But you're not really Blind. But you're not really Deaf.\" Like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Elsa says her family had always told her that there was nothing really different about her. You know, \"Your glasses are just a little thicker than other kids.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>The hearing aids were just, you know, to help me a little bit.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And so &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music stops]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I consistently would try things that were probably not a good idea.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Things like downhill skiing, horseback riding.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Oh, you're moving.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Or &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Oh, I'm looking at the screen. You've got an awesome sword.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Yeah. This is an early 20th-century German dress sword.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[sound of metal on metal]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>That's so cool!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I have been fencing since I was 9.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>How does&mdash;how does that work? Wouldn't it be scary if you can't really see the swords and things?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Fencing is actually not about seeing a sword. You're dealing with the fact that you actually can feel tension in somebody else's blade.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I see. Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. So anyway, Elsa as a kid was doing all this really rad stuff including, you know, the everyday adventures that any kid has in childhood, like climbing trees.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: classical guitar plucks here and there, slow, nostalgic]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>There was this one tree in Ravenna Park in Seattle. [crickets, rustling leaves, bird chirps] It's enormous. Because of how big this tree was, a lot of light didn't filter through, so it was kind of a dark, hide-y place.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>And I remember being able to sort of use one spot to kind of lift myself up.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She knew this tree really well, and knew every branch.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>There was sort of a sloping tree bit.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And she would just go higher &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>And I remember it was a lot of sliding.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>... and higher.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>More like whole body contact with the tree.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Eventually, I could get all the way up to the top of the tree.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>How did you feel there?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I felt safe there. It felt like an escape. So one day I was up in the tree, and then the sky opened.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[A rumble. The music swells, reminiscent of rain drops hitting a hard surface]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>There was a huge rainstorm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>The tree had changed. The environment of the tree had changed.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[ominous shift in the music. deep groaning tones]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>&nbsp;What if I slipped and now I can't figure out how to grab onto a different spot? And it was kind of like, \"Well, how do I get down safely?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And suddenly she got lost.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>But the texture of the tree had changed. And everything about how I act with my space is about texture.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh. Whoa.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She did feel like she knew the world, but then you add rain, and then she's suddenly lost in this tree she knows so well.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I literally couldn't get out of the tree. There were things that I definitely didn't know the limits of until they sort of, smacked me in the face.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;[Music builds to a single high-pitched string tone. Then cuts out]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She said her childhood was scattered with moments like these, moments no one else could really relate to, moments where she wished there was someone who got it. And she said this sense of frustration and loneliness with those frustrations really came to a head when her family moved to New York City ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[bustling subway turnstiles, footsteps]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>...</span> <span>when she was in the ninth grade.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[bucket drumming. An increasingly cacophonous mix of pedestrians, trains, and a garbled PA announcement]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>You know, in Seattle, my family drove me to school. But in New York, I was getting up every morning at 6:45 and getting on the subway.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[bucket drumming grows louder. Then stops.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON:</strong><span> I would just stare at the ground.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[The soundscape blurs as a deep drone. Footsteps.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Because otherwise I would trip and fall.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And so one morning, it's taking forever for her to get to school.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Like, with stairs I would stop at each step and shuffle my feet out and then I would take a step down.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And she arrives late to her classroom.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>My English teacher stopped me at the door and she was like&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;[music abruptly stops]&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: &hellip;</strong><span>[mocking] \"Elsa, I'd like to talk to you for a second about your classmate's essay. He wrote his essay about you and how he admires you, and I would like him to read it out loud in front of the class this morning.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Whoa!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>And I'm just like, \"Um, what?\" [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She says, \"Okay.\" Goes and takes her seat.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>And he stands up in front of our class and reads his essay. And the first line of the essay is, \"I admire Elsa because she's like Helen Keller.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Mmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>And I just wanted to, like, sink several thousand feet below the surface of the Earth.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm. Why?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I mean, I think&mdash;I think I would have been embarrassed. Like, why are you making a big deal of me doing things that everybody else does? Like, everybody else goes on the subway, everybody else goes up and down the stairs at school. Why do you admire me for doing them?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Did you again have the, like, \"And I'm nothing like her.\" Like, was there also that part of it? He's wrong?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I think it was even more like, \"Oh, maybe I am a little bit like her.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: piano notes descend repetitively, off-balance.]&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON:</strong><span>Like, I think it might have been the first time I started to realize that there could be something.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And for Elsa that thought was &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Terrifying.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: deep foreboding bells layer in]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Because when she thought about what became of Helen Keller as an adult &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>She lives with her teacher and her teacher's husband. Was I just supposed to live with my parents and my grandparents? Like, what was I supposed to do?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: somber strings layer in]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>The images Elsa had of Helen Keller's adult life painted a kind of nightmare for her. There was Helen Keller wearing pearls and smiling.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Holding a flower.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>There she was, holding a book. There she was &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Holding Anne Sullivan's hand. Sitting on Anne Sulivan's lap. As a grown up!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Slowly growing grayer and grayer.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>It seems through the photos ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Her smile getting wider and wider.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[Music grows in intensity]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>She just becomes more and more of this very, like, staid artifact. Would you want to be compared to somebody whose entire monolithic mythology is about how she had to be taught how to conform?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music fades out]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But at the same time, Elsa said that Helen Keller was basically the only role model that she could find for how to be Deafblind. And so she figured to finally free herself from this ghost, from the possibility of ending up with a life like hers is she would run in exactly the opposite direction&mdash;doing things that did not conform.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>You know, in high school, my PE was stage combat and Lindy Hop, which uses a lot of aerials.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Things she figured Helen Keller would never do.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I marched. I learned how to be on the front line during the Iraq war protests. Even though I like swords.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Oh my God, you cannot get away from the nerdery in your story. [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>[laughs] I don't believe governments should be blowing each other up.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She got deep into activism, anti-war stuff, giving speeches in her high school classes about how the government was failing folks with AIDS, secretly handing out condoms on the campus of a Catholic university.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Like, \"I'm sorry, you have a bunch of horny undergrads. You cannot actually control them.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Speaking of which &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Um, I have a \"Mad-Eye\" Moody routine that I wrote for a Harry Potter burlesque show.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>No! Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>In her 20s, she started performing burlesque.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Wait what was the routine?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>It's to the Florence and the Machine song, \"Girl With One Eye.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hold on.

I pour myself a glass of champagne, I take off the rest of my clothes, and the end of the act is not actually taking off my bra or my underwear, the end of the act is when I take out my prosthetic eye, dropping the plastic shell into a glass of champagne and then drinking the champagne.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music builds, cymbals crashing]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Oh my God!

That's quite an image.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>[laughs] Yeah. Just take that in. When we come back, just at this moment where Elsa believes she has finally stamped out the ghost of Helen Keller from her life, the real Helen Keller comes a-knockin'.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Ooh. The real Helen Keller.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>***</strong></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay, so boop!

So picking back up with Elsa, she's now living in New Jersey, she's married. She's been married for how long, Elsa?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>We've been married for seven years.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She's teaching college writing classes by day.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Humanities 101 and 102.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Dancing swing and tango by night. You know, living her anti-Helen Keller dream life. When one morning in the fall of 2019, Helen Keller reappears in her life in the strangest way.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>My routine was that every morning I would walk into the student center with my guide dog and pick up a coffee or a tea at the school cafe.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And there was one of those little bookshelves with free books on it that you can grab underneath the bar while you're ordering your coffee.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>And I remember very clearly my guide dog was, [chuckles fondly] like, nosing at the shelf.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I was waiting for my chai latte and I'm like, \"What are you doing? Can you please stop trying to eat books?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And then according to her, he noses this one book off the shelf.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>It's a bright teal cover, it's </span><em><span>very</span></em><span> 1970s.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And when she brings it up closer to her eyes, she realizes it's The Miracle Worker! [music: gentle, twinkling metallic swell]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Which is ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Come on!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. Of course, the famous play based on Helen Keller's life. Not written by her, but based on her life.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>I know, man!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Come on!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But that's what she's ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>All right. All right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So&mdash;so yeah, so the dog noses this book off the shelf, and Elsa looks at it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>The back cover reads: \"The wild animal. Deaf, blind and mute, 12-year-old Helen Keller was like a wild animal, scared out of her wits, but still murderously strong. She clawed and struggled against all who tried to help her.\" I was like, what is this? This is horrifying!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And she's like \"Ugh!\" This description is so extreme.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>It was like looking at a train crash. I couldn't put it down.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And so she didn't. She takes it with her because she basically wants to go hate read it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So once she's done with her classes, she goes to a bar.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>So it was me and a copy of The Miracle Worker and a guide dog sleeping on my feet.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She's got a drink by her side, and she's, like, hunched over this book with her thick glasses and the magnifier up to her eyes.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>And I just started, like, reading the script.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: soft, cascading classic movie strings]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, The Miracle Worker: </strong><span>[shrieking] Look at her eyes! She can't see! When I screamed, she didn't blink!]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And so she reads through these over-the-top scenes of first, Helen's parents discovering their little baby has gotten sick and gone deaf and blind.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, The Miracle Worker: </strong><span>screaming]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And then little Helen growing up into just this wild animal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, The Miracle Worker: </strong><span>screaming]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So I remember this from the movie, yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Totally. She charges at her friend with scissors.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, The Miracle Worker: </strong><span>Helen! Helen! ]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And she overturns her little sister's crib.

Pump!]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>The climatic scene at the water pump.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, The Miracle Worker: </strong><span>W-A-T-E-R. Water.

I never did this. No Deafblind person I know has ever done this.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And as she's sitting there, she's thinking &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: slow pulsing chimes]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>This just doesn't seem right to me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And suddenly it hits her that she's never actually read anything that Helen Keller herself has written.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: shimmering develops into a soft, forward-moving beat.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I kind of was like, \"Well, if I'm pissed about this book, I probably need to really go back and reframe how I feel about her.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So what did you do? Like, what&mdash;how did you research her?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So fast forward a few months ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>That was such a weird fall.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music builds]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Elsa's marriage had been going through a rough patch that fall. So by early winter ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I was like, \"Well, okay. I'm moving to Seattle.\" And like two months later, there was a pandemic and I was in a 250-square-foot cottage with a dog and my mother.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And looking around at how her adult life was suddenly unfolding, she was like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: wispy strings come in, gentle tension]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>This is exactly what I was afraid of.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And so not exactly sure the path forward, one day ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I ended up just sort of&mdash;I remember I picked up Helen Keller's autobiography, finally. Like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music starts to soar]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Ready to learn more about who she was, according to her.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>The beginning of my life was simple and much like every other little life.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>These are Helen's words, which are gonna be read by a voice actress for the rest of the piece.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>At five, I learned to fold and put away the clean clothes.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And a couple things struck Elsa almost immediately.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>I understood a good deal of what was going on about me.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>First of all, the idea of Helen Keller being totally cut off from the world before Anne showed up? Not true.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music cuts out]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>She had her own signs before Annie Sullivan showed up.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. So she had a sign for \"Mom,\" and she had a sign for \"Dad.\" The sign for her dad was just to put, like, imaginary glasses onto her face. And the sign for her favorite aunt was bonnet strings. Like, she would tie imaginary bonnet strings if she wanted her aunt.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And she had a sign for ice cream!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Yeah. I want ice cream. So I shiver.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Shiver her shoulders like this?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Uh-huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>[laughs] That's so good.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>As Elsa reads it, Helen was reaching out all along, trying to connect. And, you know, the wild animal thing, the Helen Keller of her own words was a girl who wandered the world, apologizing to dogs when she tripped over their tails. And, like, the scissor thing? She was just cutting her friend's hair.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Like, she wasn't a monster. She was, like, out there being a child.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And as Elsa keeps reading, she starts noticing these odd similarities.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Her first short story that she writes is actually science fiction.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>It is?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Yeah. It's about fairies. Like, it's fantasy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And Elsa, very early in reading this autobiography, stumbles across this very eerie scene.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>A moment when she was climbing a tree.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Which I'm gonna read you a part of. Okay? Okay. She is describing this one particular tree, a cherry tree, not far from her house. All right. \"The tree was so easy to climb that with my teacher's assistance, I was able to scramble to a seat in the branches.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: gentle airey tones]&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>[Read with vigor and emotion] It was so cool up in the tree that Miss Sullivan proposed that we have our lunch in there. I promised to keep still while she went to the house to fetch it. Suddenly, a change passed over the tree. All the sun's warmth left the air. I knew the sky was black because all the heat&mdash;which meant light to me&mdash;had died out of the atmosphere. A strange odor came up from the Earth. I knew it. It was the odor that always precedes a thunderstorm. And a nameless fear clutched at my heart. I felt absolutely alone, cut off from my friends and the firm Earth. The immense, the unknown enfolded me. [whispers] I remained still and expectant. A chilling terror crept over me. I longed for my teacher's return, but above all things I wanted to get down from the tree.\"]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>\"There was a moment of sinister silence, and then a multitudinous stirring of the leaves. A shiver ran through the tree, and the wind sent forth a blast that would have knocked me off had I not clung to the branch with might and main. The tree swayed and strained. The small twigs snapped and fell about me in showers. A wild impulse to jump seized me, but terror held fast. I crouched down in the fork of the tree. The branches lashed about me. I felt the intermittent jarring that came now and then, as if something heavy had fallen and the shock traveled up 'til it reached the limb I sat on. It worked my suspense up to the highest point, and just as I was thinking the tree and I should fall together, [a breath] my teacher seized my hand and helped me down.\"]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music concludes]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Whoa! It's like a pre-echo.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>It was basically a mirror image to my own experience of climbing trees.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And this is really her through-the-rabbit-hole moment ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: spirited orchestral waltz]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>...</span> <span>where she just starts wanting to find out everything she can about Helen Keller's life. So she gets these scholarly biographies, she reads letters and essays that Helen Keller published. And pretty quickly starts to realize the real Helen Keller led a very different life than Elsa could have ever imagined.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So we're now in early 1900s. Helen gets into Radcliffe College, which is like the womens' college at Harvard. And as she's there, she kind of gets in with these young academic progressives. She talks about these evenings where they're popping popcorn and drinking cider and talking about ideas and philosophers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>Our worst foes are ignorance, poverty and the unconscious cruelty of our commercial society.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And so Elsa's reading all this, and she's like, \"Wait a second!\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>This is where my dislike of her does start to break down.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: dramatic solo violin waltz]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She gets so into socialism that she starts corresponding with socialist party leaders and writing all of these socialist texts. She hangs a big red flag in her office.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>As a self-identified socialist, it made me pretty happy. [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And she starts writing about disability in all these super radical ways, saying that society is what causes disability and therefore society must change. And even though her dad was a former slaveowner, she is a huge public supporter of the NAACP, donates money.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music concludes]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>And wait, what was I just gonna tell you? What was I just gonna tell you? Brain? Brain?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Oh, yeah. At a certain point, the FBI starts keeping this big case file on her. Like, we looked through her case file. I mean, they were tracking letters she was writing to jailed dissidents.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[delighted] Oh my God!</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music resumes]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And then she helps to form the ACLU. And right around this time, Andrew Carnegie&mdash;famous industrialist&mdash;offers to pay her this fat pension. And she writes him back.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>My joys and sorrows are bound up indissolubly with the joys and sorrows of my fellow men.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Totally turning down the offer.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I really, really admired the fact that, at a time when that was not popular, she said what she believed anyway.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And then she makes this weird movie that's called Deliverance that she stars in. And the day it comes out, the actors go on strike and so she boycotts her own premiere. [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music trills out]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>[with grit] I am the determined foe of the capitalist system!]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And she even gets a taste for the bright lights of the stage.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: &ldquo;Star of Happiness&rdquo; instrumental. Soft, romantic piano.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> In her early 40s, she begins performing on vaudeville. The song playing behind us is a song that was written just for her act, which partially involved her and Anne Sullivan telling the story about how she learned language&mdash;the kind of mythic, sanitized version you know.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music fades out]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> But then, toward the end of the act, Helen Keller would step forward and take questions from the audience. I'll just read you a transcript of a couple of them. Okay?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>\"What is your age?\" \"Between 16 and 60.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>[mimics old-timey vocal intonation] \"What do you think is the most important question before the country today?\"&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>[continues to ham it up] \"How to get a drink.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>\"Can you see any way out of our troubles?\" [jokey voice] \"Have you thought of divorce?\" [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So she's like, kinda funny. And then&mdash;okay, and then it kind of dips into political things. So question: \"Do you believe that spiritualism is the cure for the world's troubles?\" Keller: \"No, I think the world's troubles are caused chiefly by wrong economic conditions, and the only cure for them is in social reorganization.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Whoa.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And there was one more pretty significant detail about Helen's life that Elsa came across in a book by historian Kim Nielsen.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>KIM NIELSEN: </strong><span>Keller fell in love.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>This is Nielsen, who found unpublished journal entries and essays that helped her piece together this handsome figure that strode into Helen's life when she was in her 30s.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>I was surprised that he cared so much about me.]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: longing electric guitar, mellow and soft, with a little bit of rock and roll]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>KIM NIELSEN: </strong><span>And he was a young man who knew how to finger spell, so they could communicate directly, right? There were not a lot of&mdash;what&mdash;dating eligible men who knew how to finger spell.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So he is one of the few people who doesn't have to go through Anne Sullivan.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>That just fills me with so much glee that she had that. [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>The sweetness of being loved enchanted me, and I yielded to an imperious longing.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And just think about that.

[Long pause] But then he began talking to me tenderly.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Like, imagine sitting at, like, a conference table at some formal event and then just like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[Bluesy electric guitar melody cries out]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>[giggles]]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>... saying whatever you want in your silent language that uses touch.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: mellow bluesy melody cries out again, ends on a long note]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I was so sad that I hadn't read this earlier. I felt this ache because I could see myself in the pages of this book, and I was seeing&mdash;I saw more as I read more of it, but just, I felt a profound loss that I hadn't been able to access this before.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Why would knowing all that about her when you were a little girl have helped? Or what would that have given you?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>It would have given me an actual role model.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So I know we need to stop for today, but let's just imagine this is a stop in a Radiolab episode. What's coming up after the break?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>What's coming after the break is how Helen Keller is not all bright and shiny. Once I started doing research, I discovered that there was a dark side to Helen Keller that I was gonna have to deal with too.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>***</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Lulu.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Jad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Helen Keller is the topic of today's Radiolab. So picking back up ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, let's do it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>We left off when Elsa, a Deafblind woman, was just starting to really fall in love with Helen Keller, have all this kind of admiration and connection with her. But then she stumbles across something that Helen Keller wrote in 1915.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So at this point, Helen is in her mid-30s. And the backdrop is that there is this very famous medical case going on.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>The Bollinger Baby case, which happened in Chicago. Basically, an infant was born with severe physical disabilities, and the doctor allowed the baby to die, and basically convinced the parents that that was the best choice because that child couldn't possibly live a good life.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And it became a huge national controversy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>People were calling the hospital. Like, people were involved.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So Helen Keller enters the fray. And she is now a super famous person, and everyone's kind of wondering what she's gonna say.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>So Helen Keller weighs in like a month after the baby died. We have a letter that she wrote for The New Republic, and I'm going to read you part of her letter.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>\"It seems to me that the simplest, wisest thing to do ...\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>\"... would be to submit cases like that, of the malformed idiot baby, to a jury of expert physicians.\"]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>This public letter goes on to suggest in this very flowery, erudite language ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>\"A mental defective, on the other hand is almost sure to be a potential criminal.\"]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>That when a baby is born with disabilities, a jury of doctors should be called in, and if the baby doesn't measure up to their standards ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>\"The evidence before a jury of physicians considering the case of an idiot would be exact and scientific.\"]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>They should vote to let that baby die.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: gentle airey tones]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>\"Their findings would be free from the prejudice and the inaccuracy of untrained observation.\"]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>\"They would act only in the cases of true idiocy, where there could be no hope of mental development.\" [voice breaks]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Were you just thirsty there? What was happening with your voice?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Uh, no. I was angry. Like, did you really have to write that letter? Like, why&mdash;why?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Elsa was just at a complete loss, wondering how is this same Helen Keller who was just years before saying society has to do better for disabled people, now publically&mdash;and in private writing around the same time&mdash;making a case for eugenics?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>\"Our puny sentimentalism has caused us to forget that a human life is sacred only when it may be of some use to itself and to the world.\"]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music concludes]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I was horrified. I actually had one of those moments when your blood kind of runs cold. [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And it was shortly after reading that that the whole TikTok conspiracy theory bubbled up into her world.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> And so she found herself newly resistant to defend Helen Keller.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm. I see.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But also wanting to call out the TikTokers for saying things that were not true. And so she came to us authentically lost, wanting to use reporting to figure out both how to feel about Helen Keller in her own heart, but also to just legitimately understand how Helen Keller came to want to remove disability from the world.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Well I just&mdash;I want to understand why.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: Orchestral pizzicato and piano. Cyclical.

Even as a child, it was like, \"Cool story.

So I am known as the first Deafblind person to graduate from Harvard Law School.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Elsa had known Haben online for a while, but this was the first time they'd ever talked directly.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HABEN GIRMA: </strong><span>To know what's being said, to know what Elsa is saying, I have a typist who's typing what Elsa says. I'm reading it in braille and then responding by voice.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Great. All right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And Haben told us that, after the Bollinger case, later in Helen's life ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HABEN GIRMA: </strong><span>She did change her mind and come out against eugenics.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Did she, though?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[Clacking of Haben&rsquo;s typist in background]&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON:</strong><span> I still haven't found hard proof of that, other than comments that I've seen where people have said that she changed her mind. And I want to see more.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HABEN GIRMA: </strong><span>Understandable.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So we dug and dug and dug and dug, and eventually we did find two different documents that both come about 20 years later, so when Helen Keller's in her late 50s. And the first one was that she wrote a letter to the former editor of the New York Times saying America needed to change its eugenicist immigration policies so that disabled people could escape the Nazis and find safe harbor in the US.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And then that same year, 1938, there was another huge case involving a baby. And this time it was a little girl named Helaine Colan, who in order to live, the doctors were gonna have to remove her eyes. And her parents weren't sure what to do. And this time, when Helen Keller weighed in, she said &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>Blindness is not the greatest evil. It is only a physical handicap which Helaine's mind can overcome.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow. Okay. So your sense from those two documents is that she did change her mind?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Well, that was like&mdash;that was kinda my sense, but then Elsa ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>So it definitely sounds like she changed her mind, but we also see her with more empathy toward Blind kids than we do toward physically disabled kids or Deaf kids or toward people with intellectual or developmental disabilities.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. Like it's only worth it ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>It's only worth it if they're smart.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She said that this is one of the ways that Helen Keller haunts all of us today, because those beliefs that certain lives are worth less than others are still with us in our laws, our policies, and that could have been a moment where an influential, beloved celebrity challenged the thinking enough to set society off on a different course.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HABEN GIRMA: </strong><span>I don't blame Helen Keller. It's complicated.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I see you being very protective of Helen. And I know that in our community, there are people who don't like her. Have you ever been asked if you're being too soft on her?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HABEN GIRMA: </strong><span>[laughs] No, I don't think so. Do you think I'm too soft on Helen?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I don't&mdash;I don't know. I mean, I think eugenics is a pretty hard line for me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HABEN GIRMA: </strong><span>So Helen supported eugenics, then realized it was wrong and advocated against it. Are you saying you've never made a mistake in your life? You've never supported the wrong thing and then realized, \"Wait a minute, that's terrible. I'm not supporting that anymore?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>No, I'm not. I'm saying I wish she hadn't, which I think is a little different.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Haben says she shares Elsa's disappointment.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HABEN GIRMA: </strong><span>She supported eugenics, which is horrible and terrible. But one thing I do have to point out is this was back in around 1915. A different world.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But she couldn't not consider the time during which Helen wrote some of these things. As Haben pointed out, this was the height of the eugenics movement. Universities were teaching pro-eugenics courses. More and more states were passing sterilization laws. This was just the backdrop to Helen&rsquo;s life. And it was also in the foreground.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HABEN GIRMA: </strong><span>She was in deeply ableist circles. If you're in certain circles and you hear things over and over again, you start to believe it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And the person with maybe the biggest influence on her in this regard was her very, very close friend ...</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[Analog telephone bell ringing]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>...</span> <span>Alexander Graham Bell.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Yeah, who most non-disabled people know of as the man who invented the telephone, but Deaf people know him as the man who tried to erase us.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAIPREET VIRDI: </strong><span>Bell denounced this idea of interdeaf marriages because he believed it would create a deaf variety of the human race.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>That's Jaipreet Virdi.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAIPREET VIRDI: </strong><span>Historian of medicine, technology and disability.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>KATIE BOOTH: </strong><span>He's advocating for fewer Deaf children to be born.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Writer Katie Booth.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>KATIE BOOTH: </strong><span>And he is not listening to the pushback where people are saying, \"What? Like, so what if we have Deaf babies? What's wrong with Deaf babies?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>The two of them explained just how intimate a part of Helen's life Bell was.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAIPREET VIRDI: </strong><span>Alexander Graham Bell had a tremendous influence on Helen Keller.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>They first met when she was just six years old, when he helped her get in touch with Anne Sullivan. And then they stayed really close. He became almost like a grandpa to her.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>KATIE BOOTH: </strong><span>He was a mentor to her. She dedicated The Story of My Life to him.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But all the while, he's coaching her on these ideas, sometimes literally finger spelling them into her palm, that people born deaf are inferior in some way unless they could learn to speak using their mouths.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAIPREET VIRDI: </strong><span>For Bell, speech was the ultimate marker for assimilation. Bell really suppressed sign language acquisition for a lot of Deaf people.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And Helen didn't really challenge him on that. She tried for years to succeed by his standard of speaking with her oral voice.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>KATIE BOOTH: </strong><span>She did. She wanted to learn to speak. Other people did not want her to.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And there's also evidence of her ignoring requests from Deaf organizations to collaborate.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAIPREET VIRDI: </strong><span>The Deaf community in 20th century did feel abandoned by Helen Keller.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh, wow. I did not know that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah, I didn't either. And the more we kept learning about her life, the more we saw the ways that her beliefs about disability would circle back onto her.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>I had happy hours with him. We walked in the autumn splendor of the woods.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So do you remember Helen's boyfriend, Peter?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Things got so serious that they got engaged.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>He was full of plans for my happiness.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And they went and took out their marriage license.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>For a brief space, I danced in and out of the gates of heaven wrapped up in a web of bright imaginings.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And then, when Helen's family heard the news, everything exploded. They questioned Peter's intentions and they chased him off&mdash;at one point with a gun.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. And Helen, after resisting a little bit, never really pushed back.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>The brief love will remain in my life, a little island of joy surrounded by dark waters.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>That's sad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. And writer Katie Booth made sense of why she didn't fight harder to be with him by pointing us to something Helen wrote a few years later.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>KATIE BOOTH: </strong><span>She writes about it in Midstream, her book.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>I can't imagine a man wanting to marry me.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>A piece of writing that Elsa had never seen before.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music slowly fades in: Gentle harp, ethereal, aching, floating in fog.]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>I would think it would seem like marrying a statue. It would be a severe handicap for any man to straddle upon him the dead weight of my infirmities. I know I have nothing to give a man that would make up for such an unnatural burden.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Hearing that just punches me in the chest. It is like a direct hit to the chest. I don't know any other way of putting it. Because she clearly had been told that no one would want her.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And this was actually the first moment that Elsa said, \"And I get that.\" Because she was like, \"Because I, in some deep, hard place in me, feel that too.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Being a burden is the thing that I struggle with the most. It started for me as just being scared that I was gonna be too much for people. But as I learned more about the world&mdash;and I think as Helen Keller learned more about the world&mdash;I learned more about the ways that I was viewed as a burden. And maybe it's not said about you directly, but people talk about disabled people being burdens on society all the time. Social security is a burden. Medicare is a burden. And those things stack up in your mind.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Elsa said this moment in our reporting journey was a huge turning point for her because she finally realized just how badly Helen Keller thought about herself. And once she could see that, it became clear to Elsa how that view of herself drove one of the biggest decisions in her life.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music transitions to &lsquo;The Star of Happiness&rsquo; soft, romantic piano]&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>A decision that may be the key to why we were all left with a mythic, sanitized version of the Helen Keller story.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> And to explain, for our final stop on this journey, we are gonna head back to Helen's vaudeville stage show that she did.

And they ask Keller to work for them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Kim Nielsen says that it's an organization that's done incredible work raising money for people who are Blind, but Helen Keller's role in many ways, was to be a spokesperson for them, and to tell her story of overcoming disability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: lilting harp]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, The Miracle Worker: </strong><span>[slowly, word by word] I'm not dumb now.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Again and again.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, The Miracle Worker: </strong><span>I ...]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>This is her actual oral voice.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, The Miracle Worker: </strong><span>I'm not dumb now.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And that version of her made dollar bills roll in.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>KIM NIELSEN: </strong><span>She became a really effective political lobbyist and fundraiser.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But what wasn't a great fundraising technique was her talking about her socialist beliefs.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUSAN CRUTCHFIELD: </strong><span>She was the darling of the American masses as long as she played her part correctly and, you know, didn't bring too many of her politics into her public engagements.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And in that way, Susan Crutchfield, a disability researcher, said that Helen Keller had to muzzle herself.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUSAN CRUTCHFIELD: </strong><span>And she always had to have that persona that would appeal to the folks who would donate money to the cause.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[Harp music becomes more prominent]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>The grateful smile I wear on all occasions is becoming fixed on my face and won't come off when I go to bed.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And in time ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUE PILKILTON: </strong><span>Oh, here's the pump.

Now this is the pump where Helen learned her first word: \"Water.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And turn it into a sort of museum of the miracle story.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUE PILKILTON: </strong><span>This pump speaks many languages.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Where they lead tour groups to the water pump, and perform The Miracle Worker every summer, and pump out this sanitized version of her story.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUE PILKILTON: </strong><span>You know, our story here is about her young life and the things that she accomplished. So, you know, that's about all we can say.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music concludes: uneasy pang]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>What Kim Nielsen and Sue Crutchfield helped us realize was that, in this weird way, Helen Keller herself created the Helen Keller myth. The day that she walked away from vaudeville was the day that she began hiding away all the colorful, complicated sides of herself: the radical political views and the romance and the wisecracks, and left us with a lie.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUE PILKILTON: </strong><span>We have the miniature statues of Helen Keller. We have a great magnet that has one of her sayings on it. That's a big seller for us. And of course we have a DVD, The Miracle Worker, the original black and white version.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Why would she tell&mdash;why would she do that when she had such a funner, more interesting life?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Well, we can't ever really know for sure, but Sue Crutchfield found a pretty good clue.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUSAN CRUTCHFIELD: </strong><span>This is from a letter that she wrote to her mother in the '20s where Helen said, \"The truth is, mother ...\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>\"... she was not happy in that sort of work.\"]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUSAN CRUTCHFIELD: </strong><span>\"She\" meaning Anne was not happy in vaudeville. And then Helen goes on to say, \"I ...\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>I didn't mind so much. I rather enjoyed the excitement.]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUSAN CRUTCHFIELD: </strong><span>But Anne Sullivan's health at that point in 1924 is just declining.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, Helen Keller voice actress: </strong><span>\"Teacher suddenly said, 'I can't do it.'\"]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SUSAN CRUTCHFIELD: </strong><span>And they had to arrive at some kind of compromise.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And the compromise they came to was Helen Keller walking away.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>That doesn't feel like a compromise, that feels like a&mdash;wow. You feel like Helen Keller, at this point, should just have her career. I mean ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>You know?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. [laughs] I think when I first heard about this decision I was thinking about how close Helen and Anne had become in their later years. I mean, Helen writes all these beautiful things about the value and power of friendship. And so when I was talking to Elsa about it ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>When you have a disability, casting off the people who are the most supportive of you and who help take care of you is a really dangerous thing to do. It's even more dangerous in the time period that Helen Keller lived in. And I think that's what happened with Helen, is that she couldn't bear to lose this person.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>And so she did feel obliged, even though it wasn't right for her. And I think that that was the choice that Helen had to make over and over again in her life. She didn't get married. And that was something that I think, reading between the lines, she wanted. And that was taken away from her. And vaudeville it sounds like was another thing that she didn't get to do because of the same people.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So where I'm la-de-da-ing on friendship, you see a kind of gnarly and unappealing obligation.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I think that Helen Keller really had to sacrifice a lot of her happiness for the people that she said she loved.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Which was something Elsa knew a little bit about too.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I had been thinking about leaving my marriage for a long time. And I couldn't do it. I kept thinking, \"But what about the insurance?\" I had all these \"but what abouts\" because I felt like I was too vulnerable to leave the safety net.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So she kept not doing it until one morning, after a string of bad months.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I'd been really, really frustrated with feeling like I was a burden all the time on my partner.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: gentle, long notes]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Elsa decides to just ignore the voice telling her she wouldn't be able to make it on her own.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>It is four o'clock in the morning, and my alarm goes off. And my guide dog, Astra, is wagging his tail at me. He's like, \"We're ready to go!\" And I pick up my suitcase and I walk down the stairs. [a double-bass gently plays] And I ordered my Uber, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest because I'm leaving.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She gets to the airport.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>And I check my bag, and I walk with my dog through security. I hate TSA with the fiery passion of someone who has no sight in one eye and can't hear very well. And I remember that they had to pat me and the dog down. And I'm fumbling my ID. Like, I can't find things. They're talking at me, I can't hear them. And I can feel all of the fears in my body about whether or not people will be able to support me or whether I'll be able to support myself. And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She keeps walking through the blurry airport onto the plane, trying to push down that voice, the one that Helen Keller had too.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>It does sneak in. It does show up in certain places. It's really hard.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She bumped into it as she began to build her new life in Seattle. It could come up when she was job hunting or when she was inviting a new love interest over to her apartment for a home-cooked meal. She said that voice can ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Lurk in the kitchen with me and tell me that, like, I'm not good at cooking. And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And every time that voice comes up, she has to choose to ignore it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I'm still working through it. It's a daily practice. It takes time to undo it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music: upbeat shuffling percussion and resonant mallets]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>All right, so where does things stand with Helen Keller now that you can see her clearly? Like, did this work? Do you feel like you've reconciled or that you're able to move past her? Or do you feel like you're just tethered, or&mdash;I don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I really wish that I could get a Oujia board and make her go away.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>But I don't think I can. I think that that's one of the curses of being a Deafblind woman is that I do have this ghost hanging over my shoulder. And she is a complicated ghost. She is not gonna let go of her unfinished business.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I don't think that there's ever going to be a clean or easy way to exorcize.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hey, what are you&mdash;before&mdash;I mean, it's been a year since we first sat down together. I mean, what are you working on now, just in your own writing?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>I've been working on a project for a while. It's early stages right now, but it is a horror story based on The Miracle Worker.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>[laughs] No way! Why horror?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>When people thrust their perception of how you should be onto you, that is horror.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music becomes more suspenseful]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So is this just kind of like, if you can't beat 'em, haunt 'em? Like, are you just haunting her back?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>[laughs] Maybe.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Is anyone gonna get murdered?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON: </strong><span>Oh, probably. [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[snippet of Ludacris rapping: &ldquo;Move bitch, get out the way, get out the&hellip;&rdquo;]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music shifts suddenly, jazzy and smooth: &ldquo;Ohh&hellip;. ya don&rsquo;t know somebody until they&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;]&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music shift again, touch of suspense]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ELSA SJUNNESON:</strong><span> If you're coming to me with the source material that's saying that somebody's murderously strong, and you want to make that person conform to your reality, someone's gonna die.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[</span><strong>ARCHIVE CLIP, The Miracle Worker: </strong><span>screaming]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[music shifts again: jazz clarinet with dissonant tones and growls]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>That'll do it. This episode was reported by Elsa Sjunneson and me. It was produced by Sindu Gnanasambandan and Rachael Cusick with help from Sarah Qari, Tanya Chawla and Carolyn McCusker, with sound and music from Jeremy Bloom and mixing help from Arianne Wack.</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><strong>LULU:</strong><span> A very special thanks to the talented Pamela Saba, who was the voice of Helen Keller. Thanks also to Julia Bascone, Desiree Coaches, Peter Kunz, Alexander Ritchie, Andrew Leland, Sara Luderman, Nate Jones, Nate Peerbaum, Will Healy, the pianist who resurrected Helen Keller's long lost vaudeville show tune from sheet music. Thanks also to the accessibility team: Eboni Gaytan, April Jackson, Annie Dieckman, Shannon Finnegan and braille transcriber, Sharon von See. Speaking of braille, alongside the transcripts we post for every episode, we have a braille transcript for this episode. It's right up on the episode page,&nbsp;so let folks know about it if they might be interested. We're always trying to become more accessible, so if you have thoughts on how to improve, please let us know.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>A few books to shout out for this one. First and foremost, Kim Nielson's The Radical Lives of Helen Keller. It's a fascinating read, and we relied on it heavily to make this episode. Next up, Georgina Kleege's Blind Rage: Letters to Helen Keller. Elsa </span><span>Sjunneson has a new memoir out called Being Seen: Beautiful, Troubling, Full of Snark. </span><span><br /></span><span>And finally, Katie Booth's The</span> <span>Invention of Miracles: Language, Power, and Alexander Graham Bell's Quest to End Deafness. We had a much longer conversation with Katie Booth about her personal connection to this topic. It became quite an emotional and stirring conversation. Flipped my brain around about a lot of stuff. And we are putting that up on The Lab, our members-only feed. So if you are a member, you can find that there.

It\u2019s the chaos of life.</p>\n<p>Latif, Lulu, and our Senior Producer Matt Kielty were all sitting on their own little stories until they got thrown into the studio, and had their cherished beliefs about the shape of life put on a collision course. From an accidental study of sea creatures, to the ambitions of Stephen J Gould, to an undercooked theory that captured the world\u2019s imagination, we undo the seeming order of the living world and try to make some music out of the wreckage. (Bonus: Learn how Francis Crick really thought life got started on this planet).</p>\n<p><em>This episode was reported by Latif Nasser, Matt Kielty, Heather Radke, Lulu Miller and Candice Wang. It was produced by Matt Kielty and Simon Adler.

We were sitting in the bath, my year and a half old son and I.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> My wife popped her head in the door&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Hey, it&rsquo;s Radiolab. This is Lulu Miller. Latif is actually out this week, but I do have another friend with me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN WHEELER:</strong><span> Hello!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Soren Wheeler, executive editor of Radiolab. Man behind the scenes, often pushing us towards things we do or&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN:</strong><span> Or don&rsquo;t want to do.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Don&rsquo;t wanna do.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> And he is here today with a somewhat questionable editorial recommendation.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN:</strong><span> It&rsquo;s not questionable at all, you&rsquo;re just being hum&ndash; I don&rsquo;t know, humble or something. Because what I want to do &ndash; well let me just say that in addition to being a great radio reporter and storyteller, you are also an amazing writer. And I&rsquo;ve always wanted to find a way to share that on the show. So I&rsquo;ve been angling for a while now, you know this, to get you to read one of your essays on the air. And there&rsquo;s one essay in particular, it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;The Eleventh Word&rdquo; and you, what, you wrote this about a year ago? Or so? Year and a half ago?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Yeah, like year and a half. Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN:</strong><span> It was actually recently picked for a Best American Essays Honor. And I also think it speaks to the sort of chaos that&rsquo;s been surrounding us, all of us, of late. But in a really unique and interesting way. So I think it&rsquo;s actually a pretty good editorial choice and I think everybody&rsquo;s going to enjoy it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Well, I hope so. Alright.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN:</strong><span> Do you wanna like, is there any set up? Do you wanna give us some set up and&hellip;?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Yeah, quick set up. So I&rsquo;m gonna jump into it a little bit. I&rsquo;m gonna just fast forward into it a little bit. All you really need to know is that I have mega baggage with the word &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; basically, because according to science, it is an inaccurate term. Many of the creatures we consider fish are more closely related to us. But I think my real baggage is with this fish as an example of this thing we do all the time, which is to group things together that don&rsquo;t belong under one word, to preserve a sense of order, or comfort, or control, or whatever. I think it can be a dangerous impulse to believe in our categories. Anyways, so I&rsquo;ve kinda been ranting and raving for the last many years about how you need to approach the world with more doubt and it all boils down to the evils and dangers of the word &ldquo;fish.&rdquo; and then about a year and a half ago, my kid said the word &ldquo;fish&rdquo; for the first time. And so that&rsquo;s what this essay is about. It&rsquo;s about that moment and what happens after, so we&rsquo;re gonna just jump right back on in. In the bath, Wheels, you can leave.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN:</strong><span> I&rsquo;m not gonna be in the bath, but I&rsquo;m gonna listen.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> And a quick parental disclaimer. There is a brief mention of a part of the body involved in sex and two quick swear words. Nothing, you know, it&rsquo;s pretty tame. But consider yourself warned. So here we go.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> We&rsquo;re sitting in the bath. My year and a half old son and I. My wife popped her head in the door. My son looked at her, giving her a smile I will never get. And then pointed to the painting of a magenta fish on the wall. &ldquo;Sheesh,&rdquo; he said. It was, I&rsquo;m pretty sure, his 11</span><span>th</span><span> word. He had dog, and ball, and duck, and bubble, and momma. And mysteriously, in our lesbian household, &ldquo;dadda&rdquo;, and &ldquo;nana&rdquo; for banana, and &ldquo;vroom vroom&rdquo; for car, and hah hah for hot. And the root for so many of our evils: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? What&rsquo;s that? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; And then, there it was: &ldquo;Fish.&rdquo; It should have been a terrifying moment for me. I of all people should have felt that hot burst of fricative air as a puncturing of his innocence. &ldquo;Sheesh.&rdquo; His fall from grace in real time. His ejection from a Garden of Eden I had just spent a decade trying to hack a path back into. I should have pressed my palm to his lips and squeezed tight so that no more words would come out. Instead, I tested him. I pulled up a photograph of a goldfish on my phone. &ldquo;Sheesh!&rdquo; A salmon. &ldquo;Sheesh!&rdquo; Nemo. &ldquo;Sheesh!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; I squealed in the highest octave I could reach, cementing the lie with my glee.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Over the next few weeks, he revealed to me that fish were everywhere in the city of Chicago. Fish along the mosaicked wall of the pedestrian underpass beneath Lakeshore Drive, now barricaded with yellow tape to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Fish inside the library books we could no longer return. Fish in the windows of the shuttered nursery school on Clark. &ldquo;Sheesh!&rdquo; He would point his little scepter finger, stunning the former confusion into mastery. Under his rule, a snake was also a fish. A turtle, a fish. And one morning, as we opened the window to let an April breeze roll through the apartment, the potted palm tree became a fish, her fins suddenly paddling the air. As our world was closing in, his seemed to be exploding. The word &ldquo;fish&rdquo; turned out to be a sacred key for him, one that granted him the entire animal kingdom. Suddenly, no creature was unknown to him. If a dog walked by, it was &ldquo;dog.&rdquo; If we spotted a bunny, it was also a dog. The cows, bears, zebras, kangaroos, giraffes, and elephants stuffed inside our childrens&rsquo; books, all dogs. As for birds, the robin on our porch, the cardinal on the bush, the pigeons flying with a new elegance across the quieted sky, all &ldquo;duck.&rdquo; Everything else was &ldquo;fish.&rdquo; It was Aristotle&rsquo;s same scientific classification of animals. Land, sea, or air, with different labels on their jars. One morning, he called an ant a dog. His chest began to puff just a little bit. Mine did too. I did not yet sense the threat.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> In late April, we learned of one of the few nature preserves stilled recklessly open and we recklessly plunged in. We walked through archways of naked underbrush, brambles holding in their buds. Carpets of moss stealing the show. &ldquo;Dirt,&rdquo; our son said. &ldquo;Yeah! Dirt!&rdquo; We said, pointing to the infinitely complex swirl of mineral, mycological, entomological, and electrical matter beneath our feet. That very same day came &ldquo;wawa&rdquo; for the small creek at the end of the hike, and later, for rain, and baths, and thirst. Next was &ldquo;stick.&rdquo; Yellow bloomed for one day and then left us. The tiny, black dogs that crawled along the cracks in our porch became &ldquo;bug,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;ant.&rdquo; And we cheered with every word. Two women waiting upon the doorstep of language, giddy to welcome him in.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> And then five weeks after he first said the word &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; it happened. We shouldn&rsquo;t have gone to see my in-laws, but they&rsquo;re young. Not even 60. They don&rsquo;t play tennis, but they could. We wore our masks and sat at the other end of the long rectangular table. We put our son to bed in their guestroom. Around 10 p.m., we were all still up, still chatting, when our son started screaming. Not crying, screaming. It was a sound we&rsquo;d never heard. My wife went up, but after a few minutes, the volume had not lowered. I leaped up the carpeted stairs, worried he was sick, worried he had a fever, worried he had...but my wife shook her head puzzled.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t hot,&rdquo; she whispered. I took him into my arms, sure I could settle him. But he recoiled. He looked up at me with no recognition. We tried everything. Rocking him, showing him a book, the one with the penguins who like each other so much. We tried warmed milk. Nothing. Finally, my wife took him over to a framed photograph of Coptic tapestries.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Various trees birthing goat-like creatures with curling horns, and snail-like creatures with spiraling shells, and maybe snakes, and definitely vines, all coiling into one another in such a hallucinatory way that it probably would have caused me to have a psychotic break if I had been as disoriented as my son. My wife got him up close to the glass and started whispering the names of what she thought she saw. &ldquo;Goat,&rdquo; she said, tapping the glass. &ldquo;Flower, snail, duck.&rdquo; Thud, thud, thud. And slowly, through shaking inhalations, he settled enough for us to pack up and drive home.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Once upon a time, there was a German psychologist whose name I am forgetting, which will itself become relevant in just a moment, who argued that when you don&rsquo;t name a thing, it stays more active in your mind. Specifically, he found that you have better recall for the details of an unsolved task, an unfinished puzzle, an unnamed psychological phenomenon, than a solved or labeled thing. &ldquo;Loose ends prevail,&rdquo; could have been the name of his law, but it was, I&rsquo;m checking my notes, &ldquo;the Zeigarnik.&rdquo; Zeigarnik. The Zeigarnik effect. The man&rsquo;s name was Zeigarnik and she was a woman, not a man, and she was Russian, not German. But still, it has stayed with me, this idea with a hard-to-remember name, about how unnamed ideas are easier to remember. This rabid, little law that suggests that unlabeled things gnaw and tug at you with more vigor. Their parts and powers somehow more alive when they&rsquo;re left to roam wild outside the confines of our words. With the name comes a kind of dormancy.</span> <span>The name in this metaphor is a trap. The lid on the jar that extinguishes the firefly.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> The next morning, our son was fine. My wife and I weren&rsquo;t. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; we said to each other, shaking our heads over coffee prep and neglected dishes, glancing back at him, merry in his highchair.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> My wife went into work that morning at the hospital where she is a psychologist to kids who have come into contact with chaos&rsquo; whims: amputations, and paralyses, and premature births. She took her supervisor aside and asked if she had any thought on the night terror like the one we&rsquo;d seen. Her supervisor told her not to worry. Said it was a common occurrence around 18 months, a byproduct of all the neurological growth that happens around that time. I pictured a lightning bolt just charging from the growing ion storm of his mind.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> I had done my own half-hearted investigating. Some fruitless googling and a serendipitous phone call with a colleague who mentioned that his toddler had had her first night terror the very same night! We joked that there must have been something in the air. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s reassuring,&rdquo; I heard myself saying, unreassured.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> I left them for five days. My book tour was canceled, I needed nature, I needed something. I drove to West Virginia. I hiked on a ridge trail and saw a lady slipper orchid, whose name I only learned weeks after I saw her. This swell vagina on a pedestal that lives on mountaintops. She was covered in dewdrops. She had pastel veins. I thought I was hallucinating. I missed my wife. I listened to Alan Watts&rsquo; The Wisdom of Insecurity on tape as I hiked. He told me that the root of all our problems is the desire to hold onto anything. Life is inherently flowing and our grasp to possess it makes us sick. I nodded and tried desperately to capture each beautiful thing I saw. I took a picture of the mist, of a toad, of a cairn. I took a timelapse of a sunset, an audio recording of a grouse bleating for her chicks. Six photos of the lady slipper orchid. I ripped up a tiny bouquet of meadow flowers, purple, yellow, and white, and stuffed them in an envelope to mail home.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> What I find when I get home, after a short break.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> I returned home to new words. &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; and &ldquo;help.&rdquo; To the killing of George Floyd. To a city-wide curfew. I awoke one night to my wife saying, &ldquo;Lulu, out, now.&rdquo; She beelined down the hall to get our son. Our bathroom window was sunset orange with fire outside. &ldquo;This is a communication,&rdquo; I thought, as I wondered what to take. I chose our laptops and the scrapbook I&rsquo;ve been making of my son&rsquo;s life. His inky footprints, his finger paints, the growing list of his words. The garage one plot over from us was razed. It was declared arson. No one was hurt. My son&rsquo;s eyes gleamed at the firetrucks, five of them, the best night of his life. I thought about everything he didn&rsquo;t yet know. I wondered how on earth we could raise him to be a good white man. To not think of himself as sitting on top of the hierarchy society continues to maintain for him. In June, he began saying the word &ldquo;up.&rdquo; He began rejecting his beloved blueberries, throwing them on the floor, and I would &ndash; what would I do? Pick them up. In July, we visited our sperm donor, a close friend who we&rsquo;ve decided to call &ldquo;uncle.&rdquo; Our son&rsquo;s face is his face but he has no word for him yet. His new word that month was &ldquo;bus.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> In August, a tornado pushed through Chicago. Flying saucers of roots rose from the cement as the tree trunks fell. I sat in the bath with my son. The thunder was so loud, it shook the car alarms awake. My son looked at me with &ldquo;what the fuck&rdquo; eyes. &ldquo;Thunder,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Hummer?&rdquo; he said. And I said, &ldquo;Yeah. Hummer.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> In September, the wind rolled through bearing cicadas and a chill. He turned two. His &ldquo;hot&rdquo; grew its &ldquo;t,&rdquo; his &ldquo;banana&rdquo; its &ldquo;b.&rdquo; He spoke his name out loud for the very first time. And &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and &ldquo;corona.&rdquo; And now it is October. The mysterious, white creature I hung from the porch, my son quickly learned to call &ldquo;skeleta.&rdquo; He calls the giant orange orb sitting below it &ldquo;apple,&rdquo; and tries in vain to bite into it. Over the ridge of this month lies a greater unknown than we&rsquo;ve seen in a while. The presidential election. How will the votes get counted? And will the votes get counted? And if the president loses, will he accept the loss? Will the social order hold and wouldn&rsquo;t that actually be the worst fate of all? If it did?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> I am alone again. My wife and son are both asleep. I slip out onto the balcony. I can&rsquo;t see the stars between the breaks in the clouds, but I trust that they are there because I&rsquo;ve been told that they are there. In honor of a more expansive world, in paving the path to progress through doubt, I let myself consider for a moment that there are no stars. I try to slip the word &ldquo;star&rdquo; off the stars. Or to unscrew it, leaving just the socket somewhere above me. I try to take down the word above and consider that the stars might be below or inside me. I roll my eyes at myself while trying not to all the same.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Suddenly, the words of this essay melt into paint or maybe to felt. To wooden waves of green and blue. The colors are muted but deep. The fish curl into the stars, which curl into the wind, which forms a kind of tornado at the center of which you can see is the soul, engulfing the earth reengulfing the soul. There&rsquo;s a sound of laughter which is rendered as a tiny bouquet of droplets off the tip of Antarctica. The word &ldquo;Antarctica&rdquo; is crossed out. The word &ldquo;Antarctica&rdquo; was never there. Ice melts from the brass pole around which the globe spins, then freezes, then sublimates.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> I would like to stay here in the wordless place. After all of these years looking closely at words, I&rsquo;ve come to mistrust them. So often they are used as the sober blades to scale selves away from the group. Its protection, its warmth, its assurances of justice. But even knowing that, something desperate in me still wants to hurl a handful of words out into the air, still believing they can catch and tame a terrible thing.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> That night back in April, when my son screamed out in terror, a logical explanation could be that he had awoken to an unfamiliar room, my in-laws guestroom, and become disoriented and afraid. Yet prior to lockdown, we had dragged that child all over the place. In his short life, he had lived in three different homes, two different states, he had awoken to countless unfamiliar rooms, inside friends&rsquo; homes and hotels, remember those? And cars, and bars, and tents. And never before had it frightened him. So what was different about that night? It was the first time he had awoken to an unfamiliar setting after the advent of words. For 569 days before that, he had lain with the unknown each night and it had never bothered or frightened him. Instead, he had curled into her, this hulking, formless shoal of uncertainty and confusion because it was all he knew. It was only with the advent of words, with the illusion that he could name the whole world, every last corner of it, labeled and known, that the unknown became the enemy, became a threat. She&rsquo;s flexing her wings these days, the unknown. She&rsquo;s showboating around. She&rsquo;s waving from the horizon in a coat of flames. She&rsquo;s lingering on metal surfaces. There&rsquo;s the same amount of her there&rsquo;s always been, of course, but she&rsquo;s making herself felt. Her presence can be seen in the whittling down of our teeth, the spikes in suicide, the surge in demand for therapists.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Uncertainty, it has been shown, is more painful than certain physical pain. For some reason, the neurologists say, we are wired to fear the unknown. There&rsquo;s a thumbnail-sized in the soldier in the brain, they explain, who they&rsquo;ve named the locus coeruleus, who is charged with tracking uncertainty. He&rsquo;s useful for a bit, when faced with uncertainty, he puts the brain into a fluid state so it can better run through strategies to keep you safe. But when the uncertainty won&rsquo;t let up, that fluid state starts to wear on the body. Such extended vigilance leads to exhaustion, to a measurable increase in stress. &ldquo;The strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown,&rdquo; declared H.P. Lovecraft, nearly a century earlier. But what if they&rsquo;re all wrong? What if we are not, in fact, fated to fear the unknown? What if that fear only starts with the advent of words? With the false belief that a named thing is a known thing? Perhaps it is our words that transform the hulking unknown from friend to foe. It is a tidy theory. It allows me to explain away the fear that something&rsquo;s wrong with my child, that his anguish is unsolvable, unknowable. If I can name it, I can swat that haunting look in his eyes when he longer knew who I was away forever.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> With &ldquo;fish&rdquo; came every last creature on earth. The ducks are still &ldquo;ducks,&rdquo; but now owls are &ldquo;huhus.&rdquo; Both rocks and curbs are &ldquo;stone.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s got &ldquo;fern,&rdquo; and &ldquo;mushroom,&rdquo; and &ldquo;umbrella,&rdquo; and &ldquo;bus truck.&rdquo; His chalk is &ldquo;cock,&rdquo; and the gay guys next door can&rsquo;t stop laughing. The flippered mammals of the sea have all sprouted ruffled collars, &ldquo;dolfish,&rdquo; he calls them, animating the world with his wrongness, shaking us all temporarily awake.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> A few weeks ago, I sat in the park under a heavy beam of wood that could kill me in an instant, but I trusted it wouldn&rsquo;t, because I had named that thing &ldquo;branch.&rdquo; In that same park, I watched a man, face-twisted, run hard in my direction, but I trusted he would not kill me, was not running from a thing that might kill me, because I named him &ldquo;jogger.&rdquo; Behind me, dozens of ten-ton death machines whizzed by that I named &ldquo;truck.&rdquo; I named the flat ribbon of asphalt upon which they drove, &ldquo;road,&rdquo; and in road I trusted. With each word comes a false sense of assurances that now you know how it will behave. &ldquo;We have the coronavirus totally under control,&rdquo; said the president, the day after the first case was discovered in the US. With &ldquo;fish&rdquo; came a certainty about the entire animal kingdom. Although maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. He&rsquo;s still got no word for cicada. He&rsquo;s never named a firefly.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> That night in the bath, so many moons ago, the same moon ago, the light gave off its last indigo sparks of day and he spoke his 11</span><span>th</span><span> word. I heard it only as a mother. I clapped at all the finned creatures he had just caught in one syllable. I believed that he was drawing closer, each word a stepping stone to walk him nearer, nearer to me. And yet, the truth I knew even then, maybe, is that each word is another brick in the wall being erected between us. An experience named instead of shared.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> I pulled the plug and watched as he watched, delighted, the water drain away. By the time it was gone, it was night. I wish now that I had lingered just a little longer in the warmth of that water, in the waning days of wordlessness, when confusion was still everywhere, when confusion was still nothing to fear.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU:</strong><span> Big thanks to Paris Review, where this was originally published.

And when&mdash;the story that that he's told goes that he was experimenting on these dolphins and as he's working with them, you know, kind of like shoving things into their brains, they make noises. as with anyone. And when he listens back to the noises, which he's recorded, it sounds to him like the dolphins are trying to speak to him.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN: </strong><span>To say something to him in, not in a&mdash;not in a dolphin-y way, but in a human way.

[laughter] Wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN: </strong><span>Also. there was this moment where Thad and Celeste were looking at the data later.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER: </em></strong><em><span>Who is that?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN: </strong><span>And they saw that right after Denise made her signature whistle...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER: </em></strong><em><span>Is that somebody responding with her signature whistle?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN: </strong><span>Another dolphin made its signature whistles.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER: </em></strong><em><span>Sweet.&nbsp;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>CELESTE: </em></strong><em><span>Whoa.

I mean, she's a very rigorous scientist, like she wants that to happen another 30 times.</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em> DENISE HERZING: </em></strong><em><span>Before even starting to take it seriously.&nbsp;</span></em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN: </strong><span>But still, it does make you think about the possibilities.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN: </em></strong><em><span>What do you want to ask?</span></em></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em> DENISE HERZING: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, I don't know.

I mean, how do you spend your day? You know, do they think about things? I mean, do they think about the future? They think about the past? I mean, we know they have long term memories. You know, do they remember their calves from 10 years ago?&nbsp;</span></em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN: </em></strong><em><span>Do they think about death?&nbsp;</span></em></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em> DENISE HERZING: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, they certainly see it. Could be anything you'd ask your friends, right?</span></em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Although part of me wonders like, are they ever going to even get there?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>What do you mean?&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Well, if the goal is to have a conversation and you're gonna do it this way where you're in the wild and you can't touch them and you've got to verify every whistle 35 times, well&mdash; are they ever actually going to have a conversation?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Well, because of the like&mdash;day one of the language lesson. I could...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, I get it. But like, don't you feel like Margaret was&mdash;all the problems of that experiment aside, was&mdash;she was actually getting somewhere with Peter? Like they were actually having a real exchange?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>In the moment, perhaps. But thinking forward, I believe that what you can accomplish by talking, by having a two-way conversation, is just infinitely greater.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And I totally agree. But if it's taken her 30 something years to get to a maybe hello.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>She doesn't even know if she got to hello yet. And if all she has is just a limited amount of time with these dolphins every summer, then 15 more times is gonna take her 15 more years. And I'm just like, oh God, the planet is gonna be 17 degrees warmer by that point. Dolphins are going to have all migrated to some other spot. It just feels like, ugh, come on. Just get in the pool and hold&mdash;Let the dolphin hold your foot.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>[laughs] She's already got the hello going for her, maybe, so that's like a start. And then, yes, in 50 years, she may have moved past hello to...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>A three-word sentence.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>How's your mackerel today?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN: </strong><span>Yeah. I think that to. A three-word sentence, yes. I would put money on a three-word sentence in 50 years. The question is, do we ever get to the point of...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Exploring death?&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Yeah, I don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Lynn, do you have faith?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN: </strong><span>Hmmm. I have faith that if Denise continues with what she's doing, that we'll be able to talk about concrete things. We'll be able to talk about seaweed and we'll be able to talk about coral and we'll be able to have a scintillating conversation about scarves. I do believe that. And that is not nothing.

Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Because they were wondering when they were going to go to the moon. They wondered how much dust would be on the surface of the moon. And they were worried&mdash;I once wrote letters back and forth to Neil Armstrong. So ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>What?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>And one of the things that he told me was like, they really weren't at all sure how much dust there was on the moon, and whether it was, you know, variable. So you'd be sitting there ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU MILLER:</strong><span> I'm Lulu.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF NASSER:</strong><span> I'm Latif. This is Radiolab.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>... this area, and it would take your weight and then you'd walk three steps forward and go \"Boop,\" and you'd be up to your knees in it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And this, of course, is none other than Krully, the Krul. Robert Krulwich.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>Really?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>So I said to him, I said, \"I don't know why you didn't walk around more! I mean, you'd like&mdash;you went to another celestial body. The first ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Producer Annie McEwen called him up a few weeks back to talk&mdash;not about the moon, actually, although with Robert you never really know where your conversations are gonna go, but they talked instead about a new kind of world that was discovered right here in the forests of planet Earth.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Um, okay. We're ready. [laughs] At long last ready to begin.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>Okay. So one of the first things I ever did when I got to Radiolab was work on a show of yours called \"</span></em><a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/from-tree-to-shining-tree\"><em><span>Tree To Shining Tree</span></em></a><em><span>.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>I don't remember how long ago we did that. That was, like, three years ago or something? Four?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>It was 2016. Isn't that wild?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, wow! Wow!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>I know!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>And for those of you who haven't heard the episode, you should go listen. It's amazing. But just a tiny recap here: it was all about the network that exists under the forest floor.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>It's this whole other world right beneath my feet!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>This network is this deeply complex, interwoven mat of tree roots and these mushroom threads, these fungi connecting all of these trees together and helping them share resources.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>About the forest that exists underneath the forest.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Here from that episode is ecologist Suzanne Simard.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SUZANNE SIMARD: </em></strong><em><span>What we found was that the trees that were the biggest and the oldest were the most highly connected. And so we&mdash;you know, we identified these as kind of like hubs in the network. It's just this incredible communications network that, you know, people had no idea about in the past because we couldn't&mdash;didn't know how to look.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Anyway, that episode is awesome.

And I was just starting out, and I came to my graduate committee and said, \"I know what I want to do with the rest of my career!

You know, with so many questions to ask and answer on the forest floor, why do you have to go into the canopy?\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>At that time, canopies were just basically not studied. They were hard to get up into, and there didn't seem to be a lot of point. The scientific thinking was there's just not a lot going on up there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>But there was something about the canopy that I kind of just had this intuition that it's not enough to just stand on the ground and look up.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>And so with some modified mountain climbing equipment, she began to climb these giant old-growth trees in the Olympic Rainforest of western Washington.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>Which is what's called a temperate rainforest.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Are these the places where in the morning the fog from the Pacific Ocean comes rolling in?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>And the tree just gets an every morning bath of just pure moisture?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Yeah the tree just goes [slurps].</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>So Nalini climbs up into the canopy of this giant big-leaf maple tree.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>And I throw my leg over a branch and I'm sitting up there, and I'm anchored with my rope, and I'm looking around.

So the mushrooms have climbed up the tree as well to sort of do their thing?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Yes. They're sharing resources, they're helping the tiny plants up there communicate with one another.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>The same as on the forest floor.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>It's almost like she has stumbled into a perfect miniature of the forest floor she had just climbed up away from. And straddling a branch way up high in the air, she's like \"Hmm/\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>\"Well, that's cool!\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>This was in the '80s, and since then there have been so many more \"Well, that's cools\" because more and more scientists have been accessing this new world using cranes and ropes or building platforms, or my favorite way up into a tree is this French guy, Francis Hall&eacute;, who pioneered the use of the dirigible to access the canopy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Oh wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>There's incredible pictures of ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>So it's a balloon trip that he takes? Leaning out of a balloon?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>It's a balloon that floats&mdash;yeah, that floats over the tops of this green ocean, just kissing the tops of the trees.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Oh wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>And the scientists can just gently lean and trim this and that. Anyway, one way or another, all over the world scientists began getting themselves up into trees and documenting what they saw there. And some of the coolest discoveries were found on the West Coast in the old-growth redwood forests. And oh my gosh, these giants were found to be holding these pockets of soil up to three feet deep. And growing in this soil were flowers, berry bushes, mosses, lichens. They found salamanders living hundreds of feet in the air who spend their whole lives never touching the ground.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>[laughs] I'm waiting for you to say, \"A small deer,\" or something like that. Or something very weird.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>[laughs] I mean, I don't have a small deer for you, but I do have something that I find totally bizarre, which is that up in redwoods, scientists have found these tiny aquatic creatures.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>An aquatic creature?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>It's aquatic, yeah. It's this shrimp-like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>They found a fish? [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Pretty much. It's like a shrimp-like thing. A species of something called the copepod.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Copepods, which is actually this whole subclass of creatures. They're the most abundant animal in the ocean, and a huge part of the diet of baleen whales.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>This thing is like swimming around in these mossy mats, and no one knows how it got there. Anyway, these tree canopies that, up until the mid-'80s, everyone thought were just pretty much empty, not only are they not empty, they actually hold about 50 percent of all terrestrial life on the planet. A lot of that is ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Did you say 50 percent? 50 percent?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Fifty. 5-0. Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Wow, that's a weird&mdash;you're saying 50 percent is up in the air somewhere?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Yeah, up in the air, up in trees.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Whoa!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Which, you know, sounds kind of unbelievable, but when you think of places like the Amazon, all those bugs, birds, plants, animals, it adds up. And most of this life has made a home in these canopy soils.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>What? Soil in the tree branches? I was like ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>And when ecologist Korena Mafune learned about these canopy soils ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>I fell in love. I was like, \"Okay, there's, like, a forest in a forest on a forest. I need to research this.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>And she told me that thinking about these canopy soils, like these tiny, perfect replicas of the forest floor below wasn't quite right. Because these canopy soils? They have something that the forest wants.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Huh. Well, what would that be?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Well, Back when she was a grad student in the Washington Olympic Peninsula, Korena collected soil samples from the forest floor throughout the year. And she noticed that ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>In the spring growing season, there aren't as many nutrients available.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Specifically, there was a lack of phosphorus and nitrogen&mdash;two important things every plant in the springtime wants to help them, you know, put forth new leaves, to help them grow.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>And those are rare. Plants love that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>And in contrast to the last episode where we talked about trees cooperating with each other ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>All these trees, all these trees that were of totally different species were sharing their food underground. Like, if you put ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Korena told me that in that same sharing forest when resources are scarce ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>There's a ton of competition on the forest floor. Trees have roots grafted together, there's mycorrhizal networks they're spanning across. There's this big battle to, you know, uptake nutrients. But ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Korena had also taken samples of the canopy soils, and she saw that during these times of scarcity below ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>These canopy soils had so much more nitrogen and phosphorus available for plant uptake compared to their forest floor counterparts.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Meaning that this soil for a plant was creme de la creme.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>It's just amazing.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Downstairs, there's shortage. Upstairs, there's abundance. When it's crumbs down below, up in the sky held aloft above the plebeian masses is like a Thanksgiving dinner.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>And when Korena learned this, she thought, \"I don't know.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>What do these canopy soils mean? Because they're not just hanging out there. They're not just there for no reason, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>She's right. They're not. These sky gardens, they get even better.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Better at what?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Hmm?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Better at what?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Well, let's just say they're not alone up there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Well, what's&mdash;what's about to happen?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Well, I'm gonna tell you.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Alrighty.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Right after this short break.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>***</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Lulu.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Latif.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Radiolab. Back to Annie and Robert, where we were just about to learn the true Superpower of those gardens in the sky.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Right. So to understand this wizardry, we have to go back to Nalini.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>Fine with me.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>And this amazing discovery that she made.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>Okay. So I remember sitting on this tree.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>She's back up in a tree in the Washington rainforest, digging around in this canopy soil.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>And I began seeing these root systems that were running up and down the branches of these trees.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>They didn't look like they belonged to moss or ferns or any other plant she could see up there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>And there were fine roots all the way up to&mdash;some of them were the diameter of my wrist. I mean, these were gigantic roots.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>Wow. What?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>And I thought, \"Well, that's weird. What are these roots doing here?\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>Huh.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>So I began just tracing the roots that I was finding.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>Like, you took hold of one root in your hand and sort of like went backwards?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>Yes, exactly.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>Like a string?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>Exactly like following a string. Exactly.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>She gently excavates this root, scooting along the branch as she uncovers it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>I was tied in so I could sort of swing around and move from one branch to another. I had my water bottle with me, so then whenever it became difficult to sort of unstick the root, I could just throw a little water on it, keep going. Keep following it. It was like&mdash;I don't know, it was like being a detective.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>Well, what did you think it was gonna lead to?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>I had no idea. I thought, \"Well, maybe there's some sort of vascular plant that I'm not aware of that's here. But I don't think so.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>Wow.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>So then ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>She follows the root all the way back to its beginning.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>And oh my gosh! It's origin was at the dead-end in the tree itself.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>What?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>The big tree, the one Nalini is sitting in, is growing roots from its branch ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>And snaking underneath these mats of soil, of canopy soil.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Let me think about this. Somehow it realizes that it can find soil high up somewhere, like&mdash;and so it just takes its roots and its roots travel up and go whoop to the left and say, \"Let's root not only where we normally root down there, but let's root up here.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Yes.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Whoa! So things that you thought were below can move above, way above. High above you.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>Yes. It was a real revelation.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>And Korena thinks that if during a drought or during spring growing season when resources on the forest floor are scarce, that these big trees ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>That's when they can tap into their canopy soils.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NALINI NADKARNI: </em></strong><em><span>Like, they're like, \"Hey! There's a bunch of really great stuff here to suck on, so why don't you put out a root out here?\" And that's exactly what these trees do.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>I kind of always compare it to, like, a secret cabinet that has all the good snacks in it. It's like if you were teaching a preschool, it's like, well, all of the schoolchildren are fighting over the snacks and fighting over these resources, you just go into your, you know, canopy soil closet and you've got your good snacks up there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Because we're looking for those special minerals like the phosphorus and stuff, and that's where we can find it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Right. And it's finding it in its hat.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Yeah, finding it in its hat. [laughs] That's a nice way of putting it, yes.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>That's a lovely way of putting it. The expression, \"I'm gonna eat my hat\" has now got a whole new meaning.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Oh yes! Robert! I love that. [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>One thing that both Korena and Nalini told me was that this is a new field.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>There is just so many things to be found high above the forest floor.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Like for instance, Korena told me sometimes there are actual trees growing up there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>That I've seen, like, a five-foot spruce growing out of canopy soil.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE: </em></strong><em><span>Wow.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KORENA MAFUNE: </em></strong><em><span>And you'll see a lot of, like, baby maples growing up in the old maples, so it's like, you know, like a little nursery.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Wait a second. You mean, there's a tree growing on the tree?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>That's right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>On the branch.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>In the soil on the branch.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Oh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>And who knows? Maybe as more people study the canopy, we'll find little trees on those trees. And maybe there will be little trees on those trees on those trees.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Yeah. It's fractal. Like, littler plants off them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE: </strong><span>Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>And then on them is the moss, which is little plants on top of little plants. So there's&mdash;like, there's little layers and layers and layers of life, and the more you go up, the more the layers you will find. That's sorta cool.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Thank you Annie McEwen for reporting and producing that gorgeous episode and leaving us with that image of not turtles all the way down, but trees all the way up.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>This episode was reported and produced by Annie McEwen. Special thanks to Naomi Taguchi, Michelle Mah and Nina Ernest. A huge thank you to Michel Werner and Joe Hanson and the team at PBS Overview. They tipped us off about Korena's research. They were the ones who got us excited about canopy soil in the first place. You can actually see all that gorgeous shag carpeting in the forest in their beautiful video. Vivid color. The video features Korena and other people who have dedicated their lives to saving what's left of the old-growth forests. You can check that out on our website or on theirs. Thank you to them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And special thanks, of course, to the many-ringed tree trunk that is Robert Krulwich, coming back on the show to talk trees with us.

I actually had quite an aversion initially when they told me they were working on this. I'm not a Spam fan over here, but I am a fan of what The Experiment people are up to. So it turns out the reporter and producer Gabrielle Berbey went on this journey to kind of uncover why her grandpa who grew up in the Philippines had such an attachment to Spam. She thought it's be a cute little one-off episode. And at the beginning, she ends up taking this kind of wondrous Willy Wonka tour through the Spam Museum which is down the road from the Spam factory. And she ends up encountering all these institutionalized Spam puns which I think you'll really enjoy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And just to give you a preview, I'll just play you a quick bit of that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SAVILLE LORD:</em></strong><em><span> I'm the Spamanager.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>GABRIELLE BERBEY: </strong><span>Saville Lord, the Spamanager.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SAVILLE LORD: </em></strong><em><span>So everything was family made, we have fun with. We have Spambassadors, who helped us here at the Museum. We've got 20 of them. And then I'm the Spamanager. And then we really encourage people when they leave the museum to have a Spamtastic day. We serve Spamples, which are just a little piece of spam on it with a pretzel.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>GABRIELLE: </strong><span>But the more and more she got into her reporting, this thing kept coming up about a strike. A strike at the Spam factory that kind of changed, not just the course of this town, but sort of the labor movement in America. And the more she tried to get people to talk about it, no one would talk.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SAVILLE LORD: </em></strong><em><span>So when I say people don't talk about the strike, I mean, like, to this day, they don't talk about the strike.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>MAN: You better believe people don't want to talk about it. There are still people who are not speaking to each other.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SAVILLE LORD: </em></strong><em><span>It was like the elephant in the room. Nobody really talked about it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>MAN: We don't talk about these things. We don't talk about things that are difficult or cause pain.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SAVILLE LORD: </em></strong><em><span>The strike tore this town apart. I knew two brothers who were just fighting, and for many years did not talk to one another. Because to cross that picket line was the worst. Families and friendships were torn apart. They were not speaking and did not speak for years. Parents against children, children against parents. This is a dark stain on the town.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MAN:</em></strong><em><span> It was horrible. You can feel the trauma of this strike. It didn't destroy Austin, but it did change it forever. It is part of the creation myth of that town.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GABRIELLE BERBEY: </em></strong><em><span>You know, if there's a defining moment for the town, it's this.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MAN:</em></strong><em><span> Everybody's got something ugly in their past that defines them, whether we want it to or not. And there are a lot of things you can say about Batman, but at some point you're gonna have to talk about the Joker. And I don't think you can talk about Austin without talking about the Joker, which is this strike.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And anyway, it is a surprisingly beautiful and weirdly relevant series. So we just wanted to give folks a little preview and let them know to go check it out on The Experiment. It's called \"Spam:</span> <span>How the American Dream Got Canned.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Got canned. Okay, let's&mdash;yeah, I for one am excited to unroll the tin and see what's in there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay. Great.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Go check it out. You can find it on The Experiment wherever you get podcasts. \"Spam:</span> <span>How the American Dream Got Canned.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>LISTENER:</em></strong><em><span> Radiolab was created by Jad Abumad and is edited by Soren Wheeler.

And now he is stepping aside from hosting and producing the show to replenish, to think, to rock in his chair and be with his kids and wife, and maybe make some music. The news has been all over twitter and there\u2019s a letter from Jad and our hosts Latif and Lulu on the website. But in this episode, Jad talks through his decision to leave and the future of the show with Lulu and Latif. And then, as a parting gift, we play him the very first episode of Radiolab (\u201cThe Radio Lab\u201d as he called it then). He tells us about biking the CDs over the Brooklyn bridge just before the show was supposed to air, reading the news and weather between segments, and then we just sit back together and listen to where it all began.</span></p>\n<p><span>Jad, for those of us who have been radically changed by the thing you put out into the world, we are both sad to lose you in our ears and endlessly grateful for what you\u2019ve given us</span><strong>.</strong></p>",

You guys know what I&rsquo;m going to say cus I&rsquo;ve already said it. I probably won&rsquo;t cry this time.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF NASSER:</strong><span> We can make you cry at something you&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU MILLER: </strong><span>Yeah, we can make you cry&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh shit. What -- what is it&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hey Jad here. A couple days ago I sat down with Lulu and Latif because I had something I wanted to tell everybody.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah, do a rough like...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Get yourself in the mood.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay. Well, so everybody &ndash; hello, everybody. This is Jad. I have &ndash; I would say I'm just going to start the year with some big news. But actually, we're already into the year. But what is time, really, these days? I have some news that I'd like to share. I &ndash; it's almost 20 years ago, roughly that I started Radiolab. And it has grown and grown and become this incredibly vibrant, amazing team of people. And for a while now, I've been wondering to myself, when would be the right time for me to step aside as host? And allow this thing that I've created to evolve into its next chapter. And I think that time is now. So I've decided to step aside is hosted Radiolab. My last episode will be on your story, Lulu, coming up in the middle of next month. You guys know that you'll never completely get rid of me. I'll be around and plan to take long walks with all of you in Fort Greene Park, or at least the Brooklyn contingent. And I plan to support you guys however I can. But this &ndash; you know, other founders have gone through this. And I sort of looked at how various people have dealt with this. But like, this feels to me like a natural step. Everybody here at the team has worked so hard to establish this group. And it really is the most beautiful, talented collection of people I can imagine. And this team, you guys in particular, along with Soren and Suzie and Pat and Dylan and everybody, you guys are poised to take the show to new places. And it just felt like this is the moment for me to kind of do anything in my power to allow that to happen. And I just can't wait to be a listener and to just experience what you guys make along with everybody else.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Can I just say like, when &ndash; when you told everybody, the moment you told the whole team, there was this pause. And then there was just all this really authentic gratitude and this sense of people being happy for you. Like not happy that you won't be around because we love your edits, and we love your like grumpy comments to have us take an idea further and past the first thought and everything. But I think there was just this sense of like, this man deserves to unfurl a little.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I don't know. I don't know. We'll see...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Maybe &ndash; maybe just to articulate a question that maybe is on people's minds &ndash; I don't know. Are you about to &ndash; did you just sign a contract where &ndash; with some giant company for kajillions of dollars to go make a new thing or something?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>No, the real answer is: No. No. I'm &ndash; I'm just gonna take a minute to recharge and sort of look around. That's the honest answer. And it felt like &ndash; like I mean, I just want to say this as loudly as I can, like so many of the stories that I have loved on Radiolab in the past, God year, two years, have happened with very little involvement for me. And so it just &ndash; I feel so comfortable walking away now. And I needed to feel that. I needed to know that this was in such good hands. And that's one of the reasons that made so much sense to me to bring the two of you on. You both are like these hybrid humans. You are of Radiolab and that we've been working together forever. And we share a powerfully a sense &ndash; a sensibility. But at the same time you are radically, fiercely your own people and you make decisions I wouldn't make and I end up loving it. It's that sort of sense of like, knowing where you're coming from but also my inability to imagine where you will go. That's what makes me excited for you guys to &ndash; you know, in partnership with Soren and Suzie and the whole crew, to take the show into the future. So peace out. [laughter] Good luck.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Byeeeee...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>See ya. Wouldn't want to be ya...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>No, no, no, no. I...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Basically, is what you're trying to say...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>No. I've just, I love you guys to death and my heart will always be with the show.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I mean, first of all, we love you too. But also, there's no way you won't always be at the heart of this show in some way. Like, you know, the way we do things, the way you sort of impressed on every one of us on the team, you know, we're always just going to push the show to do unexpected things, to go to sort of very intimate places, to be, you know, just so ambitious. Like those things more than any topics or set of voices, like, that's what's in this show's DNA.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah, totally. And for me, I just want to continue the tradition of always making shows that take you somewhere. They take you up into the stars with a laser or they take you into the mind of someone erasing memories in real time, or right up to a canvas, painter Joe, and you hear that swash. Like I'm being shaken awake and I'm being taken somewhere. And then I come back with that slight glow of a, of a visit. You know, like I've been elsewhere, but it's of this world.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So we'll make sure we keep doing that. And just looking at what we already have on deck. Like we have so many treats in store. The very next thing we're going to play after this, that's a one that's going to take you somewhere beautiful, that's a pine scented psychedelic listening experience about something that actually takes place here on Earth.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, totally. I mean that, that feels like the beating heart of what we've always tried to do. And in terms of both of you continuing to do that, I can't even stress how little I worry about that. And I'm really excited. The thing that actually makes me &ndash; it keeps me from being sad, and just whips me into happy &ndash; is to think, Well, I'm not gonna know what's gonna come in the feed. And that's gonna be really exciting. That moment when I see something show up, and I don't know what it is and I experienced it like everybody else. I'm just going to be so excited. I can't wait to give myself that gift.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah. And we're, we're very honored to give it to you.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Truly. But we do have &ndash; we do have a thing to play today. Should we turn to that now?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, I haven't actually, I'm so in the dark about this. What &ndash; what are we doing?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Purposefully.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay, so &ndash; well, we were thinking about what to play...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Reached out to, reached out to the archives.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh no.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>We went...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>We went into the dusty archives of WNYC.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh God.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>The very first Radiolab ever, which was...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh my God...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Do you remember what this was an episode about?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Unfortunately, I do remember.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Oh no...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>It was called First, I think, right?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>It was called First.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>It was called First. And...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Have you listened back to it?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Well, a couple years ago, Ellen and Soren dug it up. And I heard just a tiny piece of it. But I don't think anybody has heard this, which was by design.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Well, we are going to change wildly.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>You're actually going to play it?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>It's really good!...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>It's &ndash; Yeah....</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>You're gonna play it?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>The whole &ndash; the whole first hour.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Because here's &ndash; here's something else you guys don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So it was a three hour show...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Hmmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Which meant three CDs. And in between the CDs, I would actually do the weather.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Ohhhh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I would do like the weather and the news. So basically &ndash; so here's what would happen. So I &ndash; in the basement of this house, that I'm talking to you from, I would create the show. And you know, this will not surprise you. I would work right up until the deadline.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Shows on Sunday night at 8pm, I'd be still like bouncing it Sunday at 7:15. And then I would get the CDs throw in my bag and I would bike down Flatbush onto the Brooklyn Bridge. And I would like rocket over the Brooklyn Bridge as fast as I could. And I would run up there and I would like throw the CDs and hit play. And...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>What time would you have been doing that bike ride?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>It was 8 to 11 Sunday nights.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Alright.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And it was on the AM.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So you know how WNYC has an AM and an FM.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Oh, I didn't know it was AM.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah. I did...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So you're trying to like super like low AM...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>The AM signal was so weak. [laughter] Especially that time of night.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>That's funny...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And I was like, Oh, this is so low stakes. Nobody could &ndash; nobody can even hear this show. So that was it for about a, about a year. That's what people heard.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay, we're gonna listen to him. I'm going to attempt &ndash; [mouth clicks] Hold on. Okay,</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;FIRST&rdquo; JAD: </strong><span>Every radio producer has this idealized image in their head of you. [MUSIC IN] Maybe you're sitting on the couch, drinking coffee, staring out the window. Maybe you're the person who's driving and you pull over to really concentrate on a story. Whatever the case, that image in the radio producer's brain of you, the listener, it's why they make this stuff. It's a lonely thing. You know, they don't get paid much. They lug around these heavy recorders and mics. And they look, frankly, silly in those headphones, they have to wear it, but it doesn't matter as long as you are there to listen to what they make. WNYC is about to embark on an experiment. We're calling it The Radiolab.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC OUT]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh my God.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Just need to pause right there. [laughter] On The Radiolab. I died.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;FIRST&rdquo; JAD: </strong><span>And what we're going to do is take great documentary radio and stories of different sizes, and shapes, colors, from different places all over the planet, from different times even, and we're gonna mix it all together, like this....</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[Mix of sounds]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;FIRST&rdquo; JAD: </strong><span>A big brew of people and places but it'll take two hours and 59 minutes to get through all of it. And trust me, it sounds better that way. Jad Abumrad here. I'll be your &ndash; hmm, host is not the right word &ndash; curator. Guide maybe? How about DJ of documentary?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC OUT]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh Jesus. [laughter]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Love it...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>This is DJ of docs...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh god. That is so corny.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>I love it!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Ohh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;FIRST&rdquo; JAD: </strong><span>Since this right here is our first ever Radiolab. How about we string together a series of stories about firsts?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>What do I say &ndash; what's the first thing I play?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Oh....</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>It's amazing.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>It's &ndash; it was not what I expected at all.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>It made me love you even more.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>What is the &ndash; there was a...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Well? You'll hear it in just a second. Because here's what we're gonna do now. We are going to stop interrupting and just play that whole first hour exactly as it was. Because yes, it sounds different. The pace is way slower. The production is different. But you can clearly hear how maybe the most central thing to you, Jad, is so alive in this first night.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Which is that you're handing off the mic to other people. You want them to be the guides into worlds you couldn't otherwise reach. And that's something that's still so alive today. I know that we're going to carry that forward. So here we're gonna play it. We'll come back at the very end to ask you a few more questions.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But without further ado, the first piece, the first episode on First.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;FIRST&rdquo; JAD: </strong><span>Here's youth reporter, Arielle Adams. She brings us a story she aired on Blunt Radio in Maine about a traumatic first of hers.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ARIELLE ADAMS: </strong><span>My first memory of menstruation is the voice of my grandmother asking me if I'd started to menstruate. And since I hadn't, not to worry, it would come soon. Growing up, I always imagined I'd get my first period right in the middle of school. I pictured blood flowing out of my body, soaking through my white skirt and dripping onto the white classroom floor. I was not only petrified by this image, but the idea of being physically able to have a baby develop inside of me, wasn't too pleasant thought either. I got my period when I was 14-years-old. It was Christmas break of my eighth grade year and my family and my parents' close friends had traveled to Mexico. I don't remember how I felt during the days leading up to my first period. But I do remember exactly what happened when it came for the first time. We'd been traveling around Mexico all day, driving through remote villages and climbing Mayan ruins. One hot evening, halfway through our trip, I went to the bathroom, pull down my pants and there it was. Not having red but light in a brownish hue, for a second I didn't even know what it was. I walked outside of the bathroom and assessed the spectator situation. See, I didn't want my dad or my sister to know. But I had to tell my mom. She was excited and gave me the whole, \"You're now a woman!\" tampon pad speech and took me out to get some supplies. After about half an hour of wandering, my mom and I found a little convenient shop and quickly search for feminine products. When we couldn't find any, my mom approached the counter &ndash; remember this was Mexico &ndash; and in English, asked the rather matronly employee where pads were located. When it was clear the clerk was not bilingual, my mom began to use her hands and body pointing to me, simulating the flow of the menstrual cycle and demonstrating that I had my period. Immediately the woman took us to the aisle where the pads were located. Putting the pad on for the first time was a demeaning experience. Five inches thick and 12 inches long. Honestly, who invented these things? My final days of Mexico were punctuated by the joys of a four pound weight in my underwear and the knowledge that was now a woman. I had expected to feel different about myself, but I really didn't. Getting my period wasn't a monumental experience of my adolescence, it was just a big hassle. And a letdown. But let's not leave it at this. Half of the world's population does have a first period story. So here are a few more.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[MUSIC: Girl, you'll be a woman soon...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: </em></strong><em><span>First time I got my period, I called up &ndash; this was before it happened, this was during the day &ndash; and I called up this girl to go mountain biking. And we went. And the terrain was pretty rough. It was rough terrain. And [laughs] &ndash; so the terrain was rough. And we were riding along.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ARIELLE ADAMS: </em></strong><em><span>How rough was it?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: </em></strong><em><span>It was really rough terrain. There were rocks and sticks and things. And so I'm riding along, it was a hot summer's day. And I hit this like rock blog thing. And I fall into the bar, and it hurt like a bitch. And I thought that I broke my pubic bone, which is, you know, where the bones meet in the front. And it was killing me. And I was like, [laughs] this hurts a lot. And, you know, I probably got a bruise. I didn't look that closely. But anyway &ndash; so, you know, it hurt. And I was like, Wow, I wonder, I wonder what's gonna happen? So I went home after we &ndash; you know, I continue mountain biking, because I'm tough. And so I got home later and I was playing a little Super Mario and I was like, I think I'm gonna go upstairs to the bathroom. And then I'm like, Whoa, I'm bleeding. And I thought it's because I broke my pubic bone. But actually, the next day, it turned out that I had my first period. [MUSIC: Girl, you'll be a woman soon...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: </em></strong><em><span>It was three days before summer vacation of seventh grade. And I remember I was wearing one of my favorite dresses, and I came home from school. And my stomach had been feeling really funny all day. So, well, I discovered the little surprise. MUSIC: Girl, you'll be a woman soon...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: </em></strong><em><span>It was the summer after fifth grade and I was at summer camp. And I don't really remember where it was, but it was somewhere in the middle of nowhere. And I got my period. And like my mom had always talked to me about it like, so I knew what I was supposed to do. But I was so freaked out because I was like, away from my mom. And I was so homesick as it was and I didn't know what to do. And so I spent like two weeks like in total like, horrification &ndash; if that's a word.

At the time this documentary originally aired on All Things Considered, there had been other radio pieces done about inner city youth, probably a whole bunch, but none quite like this one. Story is told by the people who are the story, LeAlan Jones and Lloyd Newman. The other person to be aware of is Dave Isay, the producer. Dave hired Leland and Lloyd as public radio reporters to document their lives for a week as they grew up too fast in a rough neighborhood in Chicago. This was in 1993. Both were 13 they decided to call their documentary Ghetto Life: 101.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LEALAN JONES: </em></strong><em><span>Good morning day one. Walking to school. Leaving out the door.

That invisible barrier between audience and performer? Ghetto Life 101 breaks down the fourth wall. Don't you think? LeAlan Jones and Lloyd Newman, they basically come into your home and hang out with you. And Isay's work in general is very visual. It's like a movie. Except, better. You know, you don't even have to imagine the images, they just pop into your head. The story was produced by Dave Isay, as I said, and it won a Peabody Award, and basically created this whole sub genre of docs, which we now called diaries. I'm Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab. WNYC's weekly experiment in documentary sound. To recap, we're smack in the middle of a journey through a series of stories about firsts. What is the first image that comes to mind when you think of electroshock therapy? Torture? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? Clear your brain of those thoughts, because in this next story, you're going to meet a guy who feels very differently about electroconvulsive therapy, as it's commonly called. He says it saved his life. You'll hear tape of him during an ECT treatment. That might be a first. The piece is produced by Dan Collison. And it's narrated by Rob McGruder. This is his story.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>Sometimes it comes without any warning, or wake up, and it's just there. Like a dense fog that's descended on me during the night. One day, I'm fine. And the next day, I'm severely depressed. I feel like I'm hanging on the edge of a cliff. There doesn't seem to be any way of pulling myself back up to safety. And it gets harder and harder to hold on. I have impulses telling me to end it all. I have bipolar disorder. I've attempted suicide three times and have thought about it more times than I can count. I've been in and out of mental hospitals more than a dozen times. I've been homeless and I've lived in shelters and on the streets. I've been arrested for vagrancy, have lost jobs and I've had two marriages fail all because of my mental illness. I'm 45 years old and as I speak, I'm doing pretty well. My wife and I have moved into a new apartment on Chicago's west side. And I'm starting to think about working again. Last winter, I was hit hard by another severe depression. It took many months to come out of it. The fact that I'm speaking to you at all is a victory of sorts. I'm going to tell you how I got to this point. The story begins about a year ago.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, this is Friday, the &ndash; I have no idea what the date is today. Or no, today's Thursday, tomorrow's Friday. I guess I'm a little confused. I haven't worked since Tuesday, when this really kind of got started. Mostly I've just been laying around feeling completely awful. The depression is just taken over again, like it does. And they're just weird kind of thoughts that pop into my head, \"Well, I could do this,\" or, you know, \"I could drive the van into a, you know, a railroad pile on it, you know, high speed.\" That kind of thing. I'm gonna have an ECT treatment tomorrow. And I'm glad I have something that at least in the past has worked and I hope will work this time. Because I was so suicidal. That it was I've got to &ndash; this is like the last thing I'm holding onto.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE:</em></strong><em><span> Eugene?

But for Rob it's, it's almost more like a cliff. You know, he'll just kind of feel it coming on and within a day or two, he can be severely depressed. And, you know, just be overwhelmed with suicidal thoughts and impulses, you know, unable to kind of get his mind off of them. He'd be high suicide risk. And that could develop very quickly over a day or two.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>You ready?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>Then I'm wheeled on a gurney into the ECT treatment room.

He's hardly a baby anymore.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Really?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>The room is unassuming, small and cramped, barely enough space for me and Dr. Kwasuski and his team: a resident, a nurse and two anesthesiologists who immediately start working on me.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>We attach electrodes and cephalographic leads to the person's head so that we are able to monitor the brainwaves before, during and after the procedure.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>This all used to be a little scary, but after so many treatments, I'm pretty relaxed. Although there are still some things I get nervous about.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Couple of things. Getting the mouthpiece set in correctly is really important.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>The mouthpiece prevents me from biting my tongue during the procedure. During an ECT treatment at another hospital years ago, the mouthpiece wasn't positioned correctly and I ended up needing several stitches in my tongue.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>You got him there Felix?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Yep.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Good jaw thrust?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>I've also found that taking in a whole lot of oxygen just before the treatment prevents memory loss and post treatment headaches. Memory loss is one of the major side effects of ECT patients have lost as many as two years of their memory after receiving an ECT treatment. So when the oxygen mask is placed over my mouth, I begin to take a series of deep breaths.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Hyperventilating pretty good there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>I'm given a general anesthetic through my IV followed by a muscle relaxant.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Robert this is &ndash; this stings and you know that.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>So the point of these agents is to have them be asleep. And then the muscles relax and prevents their body from moving because when a person has a seizure, those discharges from the brain cause the body to converse and move. And if that is not control, the person could hurt themselves. There's &ndash; there could be a lot of very strong movement and very strong muscle contractions. And before the use of these kind of agents, you know, the &ndash; like compression fractures of the spine or even broken limbs were, I wouldn't say common, but you know they did occur.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>You got 140 as such. That much?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Yes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>I'm completely unconscious. Now as the drugs work through my body. A blood pressure cuff around my right ankle prevents the muscle relaxant from reaching my foot. This allows Dr. Krasuski to observe the muscle contractions in my foot to determine if the procedure is working</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Okay?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Yep. [beeping]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>A few feet from my head, a device that looks like a home stereo system sits atop a red Craftsman tool cart. It's the ECT machine or Thymatron box, said to be the Cadillac of electroshock devices. On the front panel are five knobs, including one that controls the voltage and the yellow button labeled \"treatment.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Okay. Got him?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER:</strong><span> Two cables come out of the back attached to two paddles that look like they're from an old crank telephone handset. The resident smears globs of conducting jelly on the stainless steel cups on the end of each paddle, the electrodes, and places one paddle on each of my temples.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Alrighty.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>Then Dr. Krasuski gives the okay. And the resident standing at his side presses the yellow treatment button.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>Ready?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Mm-hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JACK KRASUSKI: </strong><span>And there's a brief electrical discharge, which can last an average one or two seconds. The total amount of current that is given is usually less than one amp, point eight of an amp. [beeps]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>I'm not aware of anything at this point. But I'm told that when the electricity passes through my head, my body tenses and my face grimaces. My right foot, the one with the blood pressure cuff twitches, which means the electrical charge has caused a seizure.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>And the whole point of the procedures to induce a seizure that lasts between 20 and 40 seconds. And we'd like to have at least about a 30 second EEG seizure.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>This seizure lasts 34 seconds. No one's certain way inducing a seizure with an electrical charge makes severely depressed people like me feel better. There are plenty of theories. One is that a seizure changes the level of chemicals in the brain. Another is that it causes a shift in the body's hormonal system. Some have compared ECT to a reset button on a computer or, an even cruder analogy, that it's like banging the side of a fuzzy TV set to clear the picture.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>After that, we're pretty much finished with the procedure and then we give the person a few minutes, usually takes a few minutes for them to get over the muscle relaxing so that they can start breathing on their own and also to start waking up from the anesthetic. And usually that does occur within, certainly within five to ten minutes after the ECT stimulus is given.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Robert!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Huh?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>We're all done, okay? You wakin' up? [coughing]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>The coughing is actually a good sign because it means the anesthesia and muscle relaxing are wearing off and I'm beginning to breathe on my own again. The whole procedure takes about 20 minutes. Once it's over, I'm wheeled into the recovery room where I sleep for about an hour.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Robert?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>It's time to go home.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>I wake up feeling groggy, but a whole lot better than when I checked in.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>That's pretty good.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Mm-hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>Historically for Rob, you know, it does tend to work and the single treatment can really make them feel better quite quickly. So our plan is just to do another one next week to kind of consolidate any gains that, you know, we expect him to have. [phone ringing]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Just ready to go home and go to sleep. I'm just glad I have something like this that makes me feel better.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>That weekend, I take it easy. The following Monday, three days after my ECT I feel good enough to go into work. I'm a licensed clinical counselor at a mental health agency on Chicago's South Side. But I'm at work for just an hour or so before I'm sent home and told to set up an appointment with my boss. I suspect I'm about to be let go. Two days later, my suspicions are confirmed. On Wednesday, I'm fired. My boss says I've fallen too far behind in my paperwork. Two days after that I show up at the hospital for my next ECT treatment.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Phyliss to recovery room please. Phyliss.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Let's see, today is Friday the &ndash; I have no idea. Let's see Wednesday was &ndash; so today's gotta be the 16th. And I'm feeling more than a bit rough. I've never been dismissed from a job before. So that was kind of a real negative experience that kind of brought me down. I was starting to do better. You know it's a difficult thing to accept if I wasn't depressed.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Mr. McGruder I'm just going to clean off your forehead.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>The ECT team gets me ready and I do my part and hyperventilate using the oxygen mask</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NURSE: </em></strong><em><span>Deep breath.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>After getting the anesthesia and muscle relaxant, I drift off to sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>Okay, let's put this pipe block in and go ahead. And now we're applying the treatment. [beeping] Okay? You're all done.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>This time the seizure causes my arms to fly straight up like a football referee signaling a touchdown. I don't feel anything. But when I come to I'm a little more disoriented than usual.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Something's not right. I don't know if it's not ready or what the deal is. But I feel a little confused. I'm not sure.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>Typically, I feel better after an ECT treatment but this time I continue to feel confused and still very depressed. This lasts for several days. I'm exhausted all the time and have no concentration. All I can do is just lie around. We live at my wife's grandmother's apartment, which is a mess. And I have no energy to help clean things up. The Department of Children and Family Services, DCFS, is concerned about our living situation and is even threatening to take our kids away unless things improve. My wife Angela and I have a 15-month-old baby and Angela has four other kids. I'm completely overwhelmed and go to see Dr. Krasuski.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>You look like you're looking down. What's been going on?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, ever since Friday I've not been feeling well. It started from when I woke up from the last treatment., I didn't feel right. I don't know if it's issues particular to the treatment itself or if it's just, you know, the stress of everything that I'm coping with.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>Dr. Krasuski tells me that everything seemed to go okay with the latest ECT. The seizure was the right length and the oxygen level indicated that I was hyperventilated, which normally prevents confusion and headaches. We talked for a while and agree to continue my weekly ECTs.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>You're gonna get better, Rob. This was just a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff. It overwhelmed your emotional resources. But I'm confident you know, you'll be ready to go back to work and you're going to enjoy it and you're going to feel ready. You're going to be raring to go. But you're right to give yourself some time right now. All right? All right. Good to see. I'll see you in three days.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>All right.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>Dr. Krasuski has helped me through a lot of ups and downs. He's 40 years old and has been administering ECT regularly for the past four years. He became a believer after his first two ECT patients came out of severe long term depressions.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>The response rate is really, you know, the highest out of any treatment we have in psychiatry. For people who have a severe form of depression, a 60, or 70% will respond to medication treatment, that still leaves a huge percentage and huge total number of people who will not respond. And out of those people, 50%, 50% of patients who failed multiple medication trials will still have a substantial response from the ECT.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>Dr. Krasuski has always been clear about the possible side effects: the memory loss, the confusion, even a real though very slight risk of death. He's also clear about the risks of doing nothing for his patients.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>You know, I can sit there with them and suffer along with them and feel terrible that there's no way I can help them where I can go ahead and accept the risks for myself and &ndash; you know, have them accept the risks for themselves that is entail with the treatment for the possibility of getting better. And so many of them do get better and so many get better, you know, so fully that I think it would just be, you know, almost criminal if this procedure was not made available.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>The average course of treatment in the United States is 11 ECTs. After six treatments, I remain stuck in sort of a fog. Not severely depressed, but not ready to go back to work or do much of anything. So Dr. Krasuski recommends a more intensive treatment course. Three ECTs a week for the next two weeks. The goal is to try to break through the fog.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>Okay, good. I'm gonna press and hold. [beeping] Okay. [beeping] Really went great. No complications. And we'll see, you know, I guess the proof of the pudding is in the eating and the proof the ECT is in how Rob will feel. [beeping]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>The intensive ECTs make me a little more tired and forgetful. I'm losing my keys and having trouble concentrating. But the depression does start to lift.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>I think I've kind of turned the corner this week. And I'm finally, you know, starting to see a little bit of head above water. My activity level is still a little on the low side. But at least I'm starting to get a feel motivated to do more.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>For the next two months, I have ECTs once or twice a week with an occasional break. I continue to improve. I'm able to concentrate for longer periods of time. I can read a book, for example. Still, I'm not jumping back into things too quickly. I'm afraid if I try to do too much now I'll take another downturn. Life with all its responsibilities doesn't stop though. My monthly Social Security disability check doesn't stretch very far, so I'm forced to apply for public aid. That sends me into a tailspin. And for a couple of days the suicidal thoughts return. Meanwhile, the bills keep piling up. And our van is about to be repossessed.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>I think it's inaccurate to think that when someone is depressed and then recovers, that all sudden everything kind of falls into place. It often doesn't. A person's life has just been very disrupted. And you know, just kind of kind of daily routines of life that kind of drive, motivation, energy doesn't necessarily like just come flooding back in the absence of the symptoms. It takes often like specific focus intervention to kind of get &ndash; to help a person get back in the swing of things. So I think that's kind of the, the point we're at right now.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>In May, I returned to what's called maintenance ECT, weekly or bi-weekly treatments. The goal is to manage the stress and to prevent the mood swings and the psychotic and suicidal thoughts from returning. They don't. And I continue to feel better. But just when I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, I take another hit.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>So Rob, how you doing?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Well, it's been quite a two weeks. Last Tuesday, DCFS took our kids, all of them.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>That's terrible blow. How are you and Angela coping?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>We're holding up.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>As we feared the Department of Children and Family Services ruled we haven't done enough to clean up the apartment and that we are unfit parents. Our baby, who's now 17 months, and Angela's four other kids have been placed in foster care.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>What's the &ndash; what's the kind of future hold for you, Angela and the kids?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Well, Angela, and I've got to get into a new apartment because the current apartment is just not acceptable.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>Hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>My anxiety level is very high and I'm having trouble sleeping. After three years on the wagon, I've even thought about drinking again.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>This is a high risk time for you, for relapse in alcohol and relapse into depression. And when anxiety level is that high, I think this is all kind of a sign that things aren't going in the right direction.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>Dr. Krasuski recommends returning to a more active course of ECT treatment, twice a week for at least a couple weeks. That's fine with me. But the DCFS caseworker seems to have a different idea.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROB MCGRUDER: </em></strong><em><span>Her first comments to me when she came over to introduce herself to me, or to say that I see you're getting ECT and you may want to consider not doing that anymore. And she was very negative about it ECT. I don't know to what extent she would hold up reintegration of the family because of those beliefs. But it was the first thing out of her mouth when she introduced herself to me. So it must be something she's significantly concerned with.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>You know, it's really not her place to be suggesting to my patient what the right treatment ought to be. It's, it's really &ndash; I just think it's inappropriate for her to be saying, you know. I think you and I are both clear that your function doesn't decrease when you get ECT. It decreases when you're depressed, when you're anxious, and you don't get it right.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>As a person with chronic mental illness, I'm used to being discriminated against. Having ECT just adds to that stigma. I've lost friends, jobs, and now I've been labeled an unfit parent. The fact is severe depression is a disability. But it's a disability that can be managed. For me, the most effective way to manage it, perhaps the only way, is with ECT. [beeping]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>It was last February when I was hit with this latest bout of severe depression. Now, more than 30 ECTs later, I'm finally feeling like my old self. The depression has lifted and my energy and concentration have returned. I've started doing some computer consulting work. Angela and I have moved into a new apartment. And we've begun the difficult process of trying to get our children back.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JACK KRASUSKI: </em></strong><em><span>Okay. Very good so far. [beeping]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROB MCGRUDER: </strong><span>I've never completely out of the woods. It's possible that I'll wake up one day and feel as though I can't go on. Considering the alternatives, ECT is not a difficult choice. And who knows, maybe there will be other choices one day, after all, over the last couple of decades new medications and better counseling have helped people cope with severe depression in ways that weren't possible even a few years ago. So much has happened in my lifetime, maybe something other than ECT will be developed that can help me and others like me. But until that day comes ECT is there when I need it. [MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;FIRST&rdquo; JAD: </strong><span>That was Rob McGruder telling his own story. Dan Collison produced that documentary. Gary Covino was the editor. It was made possible by grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts. Dan Collison has made, I don't know the exact number, but at least 30 documentaries. Check him out on his website at www.dcproductions.com. I think you'll find his work has an amazing empathy. I'm Jad Abumrad. This is WNYC's Radiolab. Before we move on to the next chunk, let's shake off that last piece. It was great. Maybe a little depressing? A little funk please. [MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>[inaudible] you're right &ndash; that you're like Sunday night baby. The windows are open.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh gosh. Oh my God...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>We got another concoction. I love that Jad! I want to thank that Jad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>He was trying his best.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Like I bet there's so many people out there who were like you were then. Like you were a kid you had like, like some experience but not a lot. But you had big ambitions. You have big dreams. Like what do you say to that &ndash; shat do you say to that Jad now?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I almost feel like that's a different &ndash; it's so hard to know what to say to the people who are like Jad was then because the then and the now are so different. Right?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>At that point, when I started doing the thing, no one really listened. And there wasn't &ndash; the stakes were super low. And they &ndash; so they just left left me in a kind of benign neglected state for, I don't know, a year before anyone really heard me. Which is, it turns out, I mean, I hated it. I felt very like taken advantage of but actually it was what I needed. You know, I needed to just try stuff and to figure out how, how does one talk in a microphone? What kinds of stories are the stories that I want to play versus the stories other people play? For me, that was a whole year. I don't know if people now have the luxury of that year. I really don't. It's, in many ways, the exact opposite state of the world that. Now like, the podcasting industry is like a bunch of coked up worms, having a feeding frenzy on a carcass or something. [laughs] Like it's just a &ndash; it's a completely different reality.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>What do you think, in the honor firsts, what do you think is the first thing you're gonna do when you're not &ndash; no longer here? On your first day beyond?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Gosh, I don't know. I feel like I should have a good sound bitey sort of answer, but I have actual honest answer.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. We want that one.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>What's that?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Well &ndash; you know, what would be the first thing? The first thing would probably be to take my kids to school, and then come back. And then, I'm working on a bunch of music. It's funny, in a way, it's inspired by a very early episode of Radiolab. I've been thinking back and reminiscing these days. And I was thinking back on one of the first episodes we made. And I'm not gonna tell you which one cus I kind of want to keep the concept a little bit sort of on the, on the DL for the moment. But I'm basically creating a series of very very long, slowly evolving music compositions, and I'll be putting that out soon.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>That's cool!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So I'll be working on some music.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Do you think it'll be totally &ndash; is it wordless? Is it totally worless?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I think it's totally wordless. I am interested to try &ndash; Yeah, to go back to that. Because that was what &ndash; that was me before radio, and &ndash; I don't know. I'm not sure I'm done with that guy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Would you be willing on our &ndash; to share a minute or two of that? Like, as a little...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Right now? Yeah, sure.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Give the...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Why not?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Listeners a little glimpse of...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>A little, little billboard for an upcoming project...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>You haven't given enough Jad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah, we need more.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>We need more from you.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, alright. Sure.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay, I just want to say to the two of you, I love you guys dearly. I can't wait to listen to you, along with the rest of the people listening and I am just so honored to pass the baton.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Thanks, Jad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah, thanks.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>The Radiolab. We'll be back next week.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And the week after that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And the week after that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Stick around.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>See you soon.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>UNIDENTIFIED VOICE:</em></strong><em><span> Radiolab was created by Jad Abumrad and is edited by Soren Wheeler.

                "transcript": "<p><strong>[Jad's Letter]</strong><br /><br />Hello everybody.</p>\r\n<p>I'm starting the new year with big personal news. I've decided to step aside as host of <em>Radiolab</em>. This show that I started in 2002 &mdash; literally, in my basement &mdash; is about to celebrate its 20th anniversary, and this feels like the right time.</p>\r\n<p>For the last few years &mdash; since 2016, really &mdash; I've told myself that there'd come a point when the team would be \"ready\" for me to leave. When they might even need me to. I wasn't sure when that would be or how I'd know, but I made a pact with myself to stay watchful, to create space rather than filling it, and to listen rather than talk.</p>\r\n<p>And in the last year, an odd feeling has started to follow me around.</p>\r\n<p>A not-so-unpleasant sense of being displaced, of becoming a smaller and smaller part of a larger thing rather than the main event. I've felt it during edits with Simon on the &ldquo;MIXTAPE&rdquo; series. With Sarah Q. on <em>More Perfect </em>stories. With Pat W. on his G series. While working with Molly on countless Covid dispatches. I got a concentrated dose of it while listening to the &ldquo;Breath&rdquo; episode and hearing Annie and Matt yell at each other</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>joyfully &mdash; while trying to park a car. Most of all, I've felt it during \"brain-dumps\" with my brilliant co-hosts: Lulu and</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In other words, I think we're at that point.</p>\r\n<p>This insanely talented group of people each embody the spirit of experimentation that first put <em>Radiolab </em>in motion, but they're taking the show in directions I could&rsquo;ve never imagined myself. That&rsquo;s a bit humbling, for sure. But to see that what I&rsquo;ve started could have so many more chapters &hellip; that feels like the truest form of wealth. And I couldn't be more excited to experience their journey as a listener.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To everyone I ever worked with who helped lead us to this point: thank you. Actually, let me be more specific with my gratitude.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Thank you, Robert Krulwich, for 17 years of genius. You're the most talented human I've ever</li>\r\n<li>Thank you, Lulu Miller and Latif Nasser, my co-hosts at <em>Radiolab</em>. You are the direct descendants of the great Bobby K &mdash; you bring wonder, skepticism, and joy to every moment. I am beyond proud to leave the show in your</li>\r\n<li>Thank you, Soren Wheeler (<em>Radiolab</em>&rsquo;s executive editor), for literally <em>everything</em>. You remain <em>Radiolab&rsquo;</em>s Atlas and the best editor in the business. I am in awe of</li>\r\n<li>Thank you, Suzie Lechtenberg (<em>Radiolab</em>&rsquo;s executive producer), for being the industry's most gifted plate-spinner. And a true</li>\r\n<li>Thank you, Dylan Keefe (<em>Radiolab</em>&rsquo;s director of sound design), for a decade of making me sound good and making me</li>\r\n<li>Thank you to the many contributors, partners, and collaborators we&rsquo;ve worked with through the</li>\r\n<li>Thank you to all my colleagues &mdash; past and present &mdash; at WNYC for your support, especially Goli Sheikholeslami, Andrew Golis, and our publicist from the beginning, Jennifer Houlihan</li>\r\n<li>Thank you, Mikel Ellcessor and Dean Cappello, for setting me on this</li>\r\n<li>Thank you, Ellen Horne, for helping breathe life into</li>\r\n<li>Thank you to all the public radio stations who have carried our show and welcomed me to your city or town.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>And finally, my deepest, truest, most heartfelt thank you to the most amazing team in audio: Simon Adler, Jeremy Bloom, Becca Bressler, Rachael Cusick, W. Harry Fortuna, David Gebel, Sindhu Gnanasambandan, Maria Paz Guti&eacute;rrez, Matt Kielty, Annie McEwen, Alex Neason, Sarah Qari, Sarah Sandbach, Arianne Wack, Pat Walters, and Molly Webster.</p>\r\n<p>I bow before all of you. Making this show with you has been the honor of a lifetime.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As for me, after 20 years, hundreds of episodes, several spin-offs and one pandemic, I&rsquo;ll be doing some writing, some teaching, some music-making, some thinking, and frankly, some being. And I&rsquo;ll always be here for the team to advise, counsel, or just listen.</p>\r\n<p>Twenty years ago, if you told me even a hundred people would listen to this show, I&rsquo;d have laughed. Now millions tune in and download <em>Radiolab </em>each year. That still doesn&rsquo;t quite compute. Maybe the <em>Radiolab </em>team can figure out the math. Or perhaps, I&rsquo;ll just let the mystery be and step back in gratitude to all the listeners who have invited us into your homes, car radios and earbuds.</p>\r\n<p>I will always be truly thankful to all of you for giving me this chance.<br /><br /><strong>[Lulu and Latif's Letter]</strong></p>\r\n<p>When Jad told the team his news, we all felt a rush of emotions. We had long known this day was coming &mdash; he&rsquo;d been slowly dialing back his role for years &mdash; but it still felt big and momentous. As we sat processing, one producer broke the silence with a simple &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Thank you, thank you. Then another, and another. &ldquo;Jad, you&rsquo;ve done this so well,&rdquo; said another producer. &ldquo;You created this beautiful show, you poured your heart and soul into it; you trained us to do that, too. You set us up to succeed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He did. We both got our start in audio right here at <em>Radiolab</em>, drawn to its sonic beauty, its willingness to ask big questions, its irreverence &mdash; it stood out from everything else around it. We wanted to be a part of what was then a &ldquo;science show for people who don&rsquo;t think they like science.&rdquo; The two of us have spent countless hours with Jad: first as producers learning and making, and in the last few months in our secret co-host lair, thinking about the future. And we&rsquo;re so excited.</p>\r\n<p>Looking down the pipeline of the stories ahead feels like looking into a kaleidoscope. We will be taking you high into the treetops where a truly unimaginable reality blooms; we'll be taking you into the secret subversive life of one of the saintliest icons from history; we'll be launching into the future, to the distant past, into space. You can expect <em>Radiolab </em>to stay itself because you can expect all of us on the team to do what we&rsquo;ve always done, what Jad taught us to do: play, experiment, challenge ourselves, and above all, take us to the edges of what we think we know.</p>\r\n<p>We know this is a moment in the world full of crises too wonky to easily comprehend but too serious to ignore. We&rsquo;ll continue to approach the big issues of our time with big honest questions and diligent reporting. And we&rsquo;ll continue to honor the complexity and humanity that facts alone don&rsquo;t capture.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also do less serious things &mdash; like riding a vomit comet or spoofing a classic Disney song &ndash; because really, why not? The magic of <em>Radiolab </em>is that it&rsquo;s big enough to contain it all.</p>\r\n<p>Oh, and, hey, we&rsquo;re just a couple of months shy of the 20-year anniversary of this show, and because of the entire incredible <em>Radiolab </em>team, the path ahead is more promising than ever. We vow to keep dazzling you, our audience, for years to come. Not least of all because now the guy who made our favorite show will be one of you, listening.</p>",

This is Radiolab. And this week, Latif, I wanna play you something very special.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>It&rsquo;s a piece of audio. It comes form another podcast. And I should say right that this one probably isn&rsquo;t for kids.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay so this thing I want to play for you, I listened to it last weekend &ndash; no. Not even last &ndash; I listened to it a few days ago and it was like, woah. I was in Los Angeles, driving in my rental car through these dark and unfamiliar streets. And I got so sucked into the conversation that when I got to where I was going, I to just sat there in the dark, seeing where it went.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Because it was so, just -- there was&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Wait, don&rsquo;t build it up too much. I feel like I wanna hear it. But yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay, yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I have that problem. Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So the podcast is the called,</span><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-11th/id1566642706\"> <span>The 11th</span></a><span>. And the episode is called, I&rsquo;m Here to Pep You Up.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, The 11th:&nbsp; </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;We reached out to comedians and writers and asked them: Do you maybe have a pep talk for us?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>They wanted to give a gift in these dark in these months &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, The 11th: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;Everything feels twice as hard.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>They just wanted to pep people up.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, The 11th: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;Could you just try to help us feel a little better?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And they got all kinds of submissions.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, The 11th: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;Hey Leslie, you&rsquo;re doing great, girl.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Little essays.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, The 11th: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;So what you can&rsquo;t swim?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, The 11th: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;You got this you know who you are.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Songs.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, The 11th: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;So you did it again.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Voicemails.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, The 11th: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;Hi Emerald Obrien, this is Grammy Obrien.

We might not be okay, honestly. But B, what they got up to in the second half of this show is something totally different. It is not a distraction at all. It&rsquo;s not even really a pep talk.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>They point us toward this raw conversation about at think you cannot pep talk someone out of.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And it ends up somewhere totally unexpected. So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna play.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Okay. Let me hear it. What is it?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So yeah. It features these three guys. Two of them, Adam Juskewitch and Erikk Geannikis have a podcast called</span><a href=\"https://relentlesspicnic.com/\"> <span>The Relentless Picnic</span></a><span>. And the third person is their friend Matt, who&rsquo;s called into the podcast as he&rsquo;s going through this really hard thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Uh-huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m gonna say.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[PHONE RINGS]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ADAM JUSKEWITCH: </strong><span>Ties?&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT: </em></strong><em><span>Yes, that's me.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ADAM JUSKEWITCH: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;What's up, man?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ERIKK GEANNIKIS: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;What's up, man?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ADAM JUSKEWITCH: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;So who's getting married?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ERIKK GEANNIKIS: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;My friend I grew up with, his name's Felipe.

I imagine that's like, not a dream thing right now.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;Yeah, I think when I actually get there, it'll be tough.

And yet, when we brought Erica up to Boston, they -- she had her last seizure of her life, until this last one, of course. But uh, we had an appointment at MGH, Mass General Hospital, and they figured it out immediately. And they -- well, they thought they did, of course. But there were no warning signs whatsoever.

So, I mean, it's just, it's so cliche, but like, we kind of did just need each other at all times. And maybe that's selfish, but it's kind of selfless too. I'm like, I'm a real sap. So like, you know, when I asked her to marry me, I'd planned it for months and had, like, 50 people come to surprise us and her mom came up and -- and you saw at the funeral, too, how many people came and how just dedicated everyone was and...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ADAM JUSKEWITCH: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;It was stunning.

But right now, I'm just so angry that everything I get to experience, every laugh I get to see, like, every new episode of VIP that comes out, she doesn't get to see it, you know what I mean?&nbsp;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ERIKK GEANNIKIS: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;It's just like, it's one of those things, that it's just so unfair.

And you know, it just seeing her stuff with -- I mean, sometimes I just run outside. And sometimes I just fall on my friends or something. You know, it's just-- it's very strange not being controlling yourself when that happens.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ERIKK GEANNIKIS: </em></strong><em><span>&nbsp;Something you said just really struck me as true.

We can either fall back on certain kinds of formulas, you know, where you either certain jobs you say like, \"Oh, one day at a time, and here's a casserole.\" Or you can, I think, you can let it scare you. I do think that that experience of talking about what happened to Erica, going to that funeral put me in this place of like, \"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna reach out.

We have just moved into our first house together and we were about to start our life. My friend sent me an excerpt from your new novel and I keep it with me always. I'm reading the novel right now in my backyard actually. I don't even know if anyone will see this but I just wants you to know that you have helped me. I don't even know what to do anymore. So thank you, thank you, thank you. I've never understood loss like this. And the only thing keeping me from taking my life is that I know what it does to others. Be well.\" And he wrote back: \"Dear Matt, Oh, I am so so sorry for your loss. That must be just unspeakably difficult. I'm glad the book is saying something to you. I don't really know what to say, except that someone told me this recently, that grief is a form of praise. You are praising the wonder of the person you lost. The great pain you are feeling means great love. I can't imagine that helps but it is true. It is like cause and effect. You really saw anew and cherished her. That's what your grief is proving. And proving that she was wonderful and that you appreciated that. If you'll allow me for one more thought, I'm 58. It feels like no time at all has passed since I was your age. Soon you will be here. I wonder if it helps to ask yourself, What am I going to do with that very short time I will have before I see my loved one again? The more you do, the more you love, and the more lives you touch, the better. You are here for both of you now. Of course, I don't know you and I hope I haven't offended or over advised. But my heart goes out to you, brother. And my prayers.

I just want to say thank you for your words, they brought me to tears. It means the absolute world. I've already got involved with groups researching epilepsy to help others in her name forever.

I'd like you to read about our engagement story to let you know who we were and not just strangers. I hope that you read it. But if not, I understand. I don't even know really why I'm sending it. I just want you to know who we were. I want everyone to know who she was and what she did for me. But again, if not, I completely understand. You have already done so much for me. Thank you, George and I wish you well.\" And he wrote back: \"Matt, this is so beautiful. It seems you have experienced a wonderful love in your life, as did she. She was a very lucky person to have you in her life. She knew love. And that's for sure. A beautiful engagement story. Such a thoughtful and dreamlike way of doing it. I will say this, you have known love and known loss. Your work with epilepsy groups will mean that you are minimizing loss and suffering in the world.

Like, you're living for both of you now.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>&nbsp;Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>&nbsp;Like, and it's like, here's the -- it's like, here's a way to bear the future.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>&nbsp;Well, thank you, Lulu, for playing that for me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>&nbsp;You're welcome. Huge thanks to the team at The 11th. Big thanks also to the folks at Relentless Picnic. A little update about Matt. In the almost five years since that conversation took place, he has fallen in love, gotten married, had a baby. And he now works as a volunteer grief counselor to people who've lost someone due to a sudden unexpected death from epilepsy. And finally, a big thanks to Lu Olwkowski. She is the one who said I had to hear that conversation. And actually Lu did one of the most stunning pieces we've ever done at Radiolab. It's called, Grandpa. And it is also about two people looking very closely at death. I highly recommend you check it out.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>&nbsp;And if for some reason you don't want to listen to more stories about death. I recommend you listen to a story we did called The Luckiest Lobster, about a woman who rescued a lobster from a grocery store. [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>&nbsp;Yes. Or that one! Either way. Thank you for listening. We'll be back next week.</span><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>UNIDENTIFIED VOICE:</em></strong><em><span> Radiolab was created by Jad Abumrad and is edited by Soren Wheeler.

Cyber criminals today have more sophisticated tools, have learned to work collaboratively around the world and have found innovative ways to remain deep undercover in the internet's shadows. This episode, we shine a light into those shadows to see the world from the perspectives of both cybercrime victims and perpetrators.</span></p>\n<p><span>First we meet mother-daughter duo Alina and Inna Simone, who tell us about being held hostage by criminals who have burrowed into their lives from half a world away. Along the way we learn about the legally sticky spot that unwitting accomplices like Will Wheeler find themselves in.</span></p>\n<p><span>Then reporter and author Joseph Menn tells us about the surprisingly lucrative professional hacker structure in places throughout the former Soviet Union. Finally, the co-creator of one of the most notorious online marketplaces to ever exist speaks to us and NPR cyber-crime expert Dina Temple-Raston about how a young suburban Boy Scout can turn into a world renowned black hat hacker.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Support Radiolab by becoming a member today at </span></em><a href=\"https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab/onestep/\"><em><span>Radiolab.org/donate</span></em></a><em><span>.<br></span></em><span><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaum_fMDGgFQCmKHUBPq_xg\"><strong>Radiolab is on YouTube!</strong></a> <span>Catch up with new episodes and hear classics from our archive.

I'm Jad Abumrad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT KRULWICH:</strong><span> I'm Robert Krulwich.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>This is Radiolab and today&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT: </strong><span>Well, today we're going to tell you a story which we hope does not become your future, but it raises a simple question. We all have computers. We love computers. We depend upon computers. But what if the cost of using your computer becomes more than you're willing to pay? Two stories today, which suggest that we might be at the very beginning of a nightmare.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs] The first comes from a journalist, Alina Simone and her mother, Inna.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALINA SIMONE: </em></strong><em><span>I mean, do you want to start with my mom? Because it really happened to her. You know, she only got in touch with me maybe on day six.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Are you talking to me, or her?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALINA SIMONE: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>Okay. So what &ndash; yeah, day one. What was the first, first thing that happened?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>On day one, what happened that I called Tufts University IT services &ndash; because my husband works at Tufts &ndash; complaining that my computer is unbearably, unbearably slow.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>She tells IT, \"I don't know what's going on. Every time I try an open a window, it's like 'click ... oop ... click.. oop.'\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Practically stopped working.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>\"What do I do?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>They checked, whatever, said, \"Probably nothing.\" Rebooted.

They've surpassed the US in educating their kids when it comes to math and science. And they've got a severe underemployment problem, especially outside of the major cities, which is where these viruses often trace down to. Not Moscow and St. Petersburg but we're talking about, you know, backwater.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>I was so positive that it comes from that part of the world that I wrote them in Russian.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Apparently the criminals, they had provided her a link to a website where she could send them a message. You know, customer support.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>I wrote them [speaks Russian]. I don't know how to translate it in English more accurately. Something like, \"I wish you all die,\" or \"Drop dead.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Wish you all die?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>But in Russian language, there is a word &ldquo;to die&rdquo; for humans, or another word for animals.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>So you said&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Oh! You used the animal one.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Yes. Not a curse, but you know &ndash; they got the message.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Now, Inna says she thought about just wiping the computer clean. So that she wouldn't have to pay.But then it occurred to her that her husband had all these files on there&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Which he needed.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>You know, like business receipts that he hadn't filed yet.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Which he's lazy to do so he asked me to help.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALINA SIMONE: </em></strong><em><span>And she's right, that like, you know, she has this tax information, this reimbursement information. Ultimately, it's worth more than 500 dollars.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>My husband did not want to pay, I overruled him.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So Inna decides&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>To follow the instructions, basically.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBOT: </em></strong><em><span>One. Download and install Tor browser.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So she goes and installs this browser called Tor, which apparently&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Is not traceable.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBOT: </em></strong><em><span>Two. Run the browser and wait for initialization.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>She does that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBOT: </em></strong><em><span>Three. Type in the address bar, K-PI-7-Y-C-R-7-J-A-X-Q&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Then she's directed to a site where it basically tells her, \"Look, if you don't trust us&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>\"We can decrypt one of your files for free, as a sample that when you pay us, you would know that you could really get all your files back.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>Huh.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>And I was curious. I decided that I will try it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So she clicked the button that said yes and doo-do-loop!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>I got one file back, but as soon as I did, the clock start ticking.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Literally, she says a little clock appeared at the top of the browser.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>They gave me exactly seven days.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBOT: </em></strong><em><span>167 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>Oh. So you decrypt the thing and then suddenly it's a countdown?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Yes! They say, \"If you won't pay by this date, then the fine will be doubled and if you won't pay in one more week, then you will lose your files forever and you will never get it back.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Now, in the message it had told Inna that she had to pay that 500 dollar fine not in dollars, but in Bitcoin.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC OUT]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>You know, I &ndash; this was the first time in my life, ever, I heard the term 'Bitcoins.' So I found this website&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Called coincafe.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Where you can buy Bitcoins. And to buy these Bitcoins is a nightmare. It's a torture.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>What she needed to do was exchange 500 bucks for the requisite amount of Bitcoins. And at the time 500 bucks equaled 1.37 Bitcoins. But before she could even make that exchange, she had to fill out all these forms with all these questions.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>\"What happened? What is the reason to buy Bitcoin?\" And reasons were listed, one of them was ransom. So they knew, they knew&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>[laughs] That's a category?!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Yes. It was the first reason, to pay a ransom to the criminals.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Next, she says after you fill out all the forms&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>You have to make a picture and send them a photograph through the internet. Okay? I did not have a camera because&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>She says your camera happened to be in the shop.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Oh! More than that, I have to make a picture of my husband holding a driver's license. Send them this picture back so they would&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>But is this the bank, or the criminals? Or the&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>No!

I told you that it's a torture. It's unbelievable.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC OUT]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>But eventually she was able to find a neighbor, borrow the camera, take the picture she needed to take. Then she had to get the money she wanted to exchange to coincafe and it turns out the preferred way to do it, the most secure way to do it, is not online, but through a money order.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>This was the day right before the Thanksgiving, Wednesday.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>She still had about six days before the deadline, so she thought, \"All </span></em><span>right, I'll just pop down to the post office, get a money order.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>But&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>NEWS CLIP:</em></strong><em><span> Live from Boston, WVT&hellip;]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Lexington and the whole Massachusetts had a terrible, terrible snow storms.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>NEWS CLIP:</em></strong><em><span> For a lot of us, this could be the biggest storm so far this winter&hellip;]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>Undriveable roads...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>NEWS CLIP:</em></strong><em><span> And significant snow, a wet snow at that&hellip;]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>INNA: </em></strong><em><span>But I had to go to the post office.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So she plows through the snow, almost kills herself, but gets there, gets everything together, sends it off.

One of the easiest ways to make money on the internet, back pre-2000, was spam.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>Spam as in, &ldquo;penis extensions&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in Nairobi and&hellip;&rdquo;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JOSEPH MENN: </em></strong><em><span>All that stuff.

And send spam from that.&nbsp;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So what they did, which is totally genius, totally evil, is they hired a bunch of programmers to create a bunch of viruses. Disseminated those viruses across the internet. People would accidentally click or open something, get them onto their, you know, computer, and then suddenly the spammers could now remote control our computers at a distance, for whatever they wanted, for maybe just an hour or two a night, to send out their spam. Because these were clean IP addresses.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC OUT]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JOSEPH MENN: </em></strong><em><span>Of course, what happened is that once the spammers had these botnets&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>They started thinking&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JOSEPH MENN: </em></strong><em><span>\"Hey, I could do something else with this.\" And the next thing that came along was denial of service attacks.

To fast forward, as Dan went the opposite direction of the script kitties and got better and better and started making these botnets that could literally spy on people as they were using their computers&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLACEK: </em></strong><em><span>Interesting to see all the porn that people are watching, that type of thing.

But, you know, they also want to be able to sell some of the stuff they're making. So let's invite some people who would be willing to buy some of this stuff.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>This now begins to sound like a fair. You say, \"Oh, I have a burglar's tool. Do you have a door you want a burgle?\" And then you're like, \"I'll rent you my tool.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLACEK: </em></strong><em><span>That's a simplification, but yeah.&nbsp; People would post and say, \"I am looking to buy X,\" or \"Here's this piece of software I created. Here's all the things it does, here's some screenshots of it in action. And here's the price.\" Could be a certain type of botnet software. It could be buying a botnet itself. You know, if you don't want to build one yourself, you want to buy one that somebody else already created and has going.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT: </em></strong><em><span>You mean, \"I can get you onto 200,000 or 20,000 computers. Just give me a check?\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLACEK: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah. What they called them were &ldquo;installs.&rdquo;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>Installs.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLACEK: </em></strong><em><span>You know, \"Hey guys, I've got installs and they're 10 dollars per 1,000,\" something like that.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>Wow.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Now, this is something that's sort of surprising to us, that when it comes to botnets, that there's this whole rental market that's frighteningly affordable.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KELLY JACKSON HIGGINS: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, it's bargain basement.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>In fact, we were talking with one reporter, Kelly Jackson Higgins, who's the executive editor of darkreading.com which is a cyber security news site. And she told us&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KELLY JACKSON HIGGINS: </em></strong><em><span>You know, you can actually rent a botnet if you really wanted to. You could rent a botnet for one hour for about 38 dollars a month&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>What?!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KELLY JACKSON HIGGINS: </em></strong><em><span>And, in some cases, as low as 20&nbsp; &ndash; yes &ndash; as low as 20 dollars a month. So it&hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I can rent a botnet for 20 bucks a month?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KELLY JACKSON HIGGINS: </em></strong><em><span>You could. It's like renting space, \"Here, you want to use this to go do damage somewhere, or you want to make a statement, or you have some plan for it? Do you want to send some spam? Here you go.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLACEK: </em></strong><em><span>You could go online right now and probably find somewhere out there on the net, somebody who will sell you access to computers for cents apiece.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And these are like people's computers, like your computer, my computer. And Dan says as Darkode got bigger and bigger, he began to see more of this kind of activity on the site. Like some guy would have a botnet of 5,000 computers. Another guy would have some software, like, the ransomware. Software guy would then rent the botnet from guy one, install his ransomware, ransom these poor people, then move on.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLACEK: </em></strong><em><span>You know, some of the people were doing some pretty unpleasant things. You know, moving more into the kind of financial crimes territory, which is something that I really never had a desire to be involved in.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC OUT]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And it was largely because of that, he says, that in 2009 he decided to get out. But, unfortunately, the next year...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLACEK: </em></strong><em><span>I got a lovely visit from the FBI. They promptly ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>Was it like a, &ldquo;kick down in your door&rdquo; type situation?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLACEK: </em></strong><em><span>They knocked, they knocked. [laughter] So it was...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>Okay. What was that like?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLACEK: </em></strong><em><span>Pretty terrifying, you know. What's &ndash; what&rsquo;s going to happen to me? What's going to happen next?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAD: </em></strong><em><span>And what did happen next?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLACEK: </em></strong><em><span>I don't know how much of that I can talk about, but I did cooperate with the government, and I have cooperated with them for the last, you know, five plus years now. It was a kick in the butts. You know, my parents kind of kicked me out. Not &ndash; not kicked me out but assisted me with a rapid move out. [laughter] And I've been living on my own since then and became gainfully employed. Had a few jobs, became a little bit more, more serious with my then-girlfriend, who is now my wife. So, you know, it's given me an opportunity over the last five years to really make some serious changes to my life.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC IN]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Meanwhile, over the same five years, Darkode grew into this massive cyber criminal swap meet, where tens of thousands of stolen Social Security numbers were bought and sold. Huge databases of personal information and emails were bought and sold. Malware and software of various kinds are bought and sold. And this continued, according to Dina Temple-Raston, right up into July 15 of this year, July 15, 2015.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[MUSIC OUT]</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, David Hickton:</em></strong><em><span> Today marks a milestone in our efforts to bring to justice some of the most significant cyber criminals in the world.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DINA TEMPLE-RASTON: </em></strong><em><span>What ended up happening on July 15 is that the FBI had actually got into Darkode with a number of intelligence services from around the world.

This is Radiolab.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU MILLER:</strong><span> I'm getting all settled. Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD ABUMRAD:</strong><span> Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>And to kick off this new year, our very first episode of 2022, Jad and Lulu and I were supposed to have a conversation about what our favorite things were from the last year. Like, books and movies, that kind of thing.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Let's do it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>But I have brought you both here with a ruse. I mean, we may do favorite things but that's not what I'm prepared to do today.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wait, so that was a fake-out?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>I prepared my favorite things!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I'm hijacking you both.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Ooh, okay!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Okay, you ready?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Very.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So we are starting a new year. It feels kinda like the last two sort of blur together, and I'm constantly thinking, like, which was worse: 2020 or 2021? But then that took me to a different place which is like, what was the worst year ever?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Not in recent memory, but in human history. Like, was there an objectively worst year to be a person alive on planet Earth?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>My mind goes to parameter questions.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Okay, great.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>When is the boundaries?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So maybe let's say the worst year in recorded history.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Got it. And then \"worst?\" Do you have, like, an operating definition for that?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Maybe something that, like&mdash;that hit a lot of people in a way that if we were alive then and we had a choice between living then and living now, we would say \"Yes, please. 2020 or 2021, please.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm. You are a sick, sick mind, Latif.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Well, I admit it's kind of a dark thought to have, but I was thinking about it in a kind of positive way. Like, the worst year in human history, if I can pin that down, I'll at least know that 2022 is almost certainly not gonna be as bad as that. And then I'll feel better about that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And, like, whatever's ahead?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And whatever's ahead.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So fully embracing the suck that is 2020 and 2021, what year would you pit up against it to say \"This is a worthy adversary?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>I was thinking Pompeii.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>The Black Death.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, that's gotta be top five. At least if you're, like&mdash;if you're just gonna focus on Europe. Top five.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>You could do 1939.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Crusades. Wasn't that the 12th century?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Crusades.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>1781.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Mongolian invasion.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Which was actually&mdash;there are some really good things that came out of that. So&mdash;so, you know, hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I mean, you could say, like, 1492 from the American perspective.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yes! Yes!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>I recently came across this thing that in 1100 AD, the moon disappeared for a lot of the year.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>It disappeared?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So I think that would be ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>... terrifying as either someone who is spiritual or isn't.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Mm-hmm. This is very interesting because you're bringing up a lot of stuff that I'm gonna bring up, too.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>But so okay. So the year, the year that I think I want to make a case that this&mdash;that this is the worst year in human history is 536 AD.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>536.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Whoa!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay. All right, what's happening in the world in 536?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Okay. So just a quick picture of what the world looked like around the 530s: a few hundred million humans on planet Earth or thereabouts. The Roman Empire, you know, fully flowered, then it fractured into two. A similar thing had happened in China. It also fractured. It is the classic period of the Mayan civilization in Central America. So these are like societies. These are real societies, you know, with major cities and sewage systems and music scenes and stuff like that. Like, it's like we're not quite in the modern world, but we're in, like, in a world we recognize.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay, so toilets and&mdash;toilets and lutes.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Basically, yeah. Okay, so what happens in 536 is not particularly clear. The leading theory is a volcanic eruption.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So this is a singular eruption, or is it a string of them?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Almost certainly a string of them, but at least one of them was enormous. Unclear where this eruption happened exactly, but spewed out ash and sulfates and even tiny bits of glass into the stratosphere.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Where it circulated around the Earth. But there's&mdash;there's actually&mdash;there's another thing that happened, there's kind of an extra twist, which is that I spoke to this one scholar and what she thinks happened was that a few years prior, Halley's Comet passed by Earth and basically whipped us with its tail. And so the debris from that tail entered our atmosphere, broke up in the night sky, and you could actually see it twinkling.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Can you imagine if the two things were separate events but happened on the same day. Can you imagine that?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>That would be crazy. That would be ama&mdash;or it could have been something completely different that triggered all this. But this is, like, best guesses. So whether it was the volcanic sort of plume or whether it was the comet, like, debris, it creates this thing they call a dust veil over the Earth. And that triggers other strange regional weather patterns including dust storms which cause even more dust. So in November and December of 536 in the Chinese city of Nanjing, there's a report from the city that said, quote, \"Yellow dust rained down like snow. It could be scooped up in handfuls.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And that lasts from February, 536 to June, 537. So a year-and-a-half basically of solid winter.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Ooh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>That's Game of Thrones shit right there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah. It's basically the coldest decade in the last 2,000 years. And that triggers, like, massive crop failures and, you know, mass famine. So in Ireland in 536 and then also in 539, it's written in their annals that they have a quote, \"failure of bread.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Similar food shortages are documented in Korea, Japan. In China it gets so bad by the 540s that in one area north of the Yellow River, seven or eight out of every ten people died. And because the crops had failed, allegedly, survivors were forced to eat the corpses of the dead.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>No! No!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh my God!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>One of the places where this hit worst was Scandinavia. 75 percent of the villages that they excavate from around that time, like, you can tell that they were abandoned. Basically, it's like all these Nordic people are like, \"Screw it. We're getting out of here.\" And then they get on their boats and then they, like, travel around the world and they ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow. All you need now is like an alien invasion and&mdash;I don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Well, there's&mdash;I mean, there is more. Another issue with this massive dust veil that some people have speculated about is, like, people were not getting a lot of sunlight, so they're not creating vitamin D in their bodies. And vitamin D, among other things, helps boost your immune system to fight bacterial infections. And also you can imagine there are all these farms and fields with crops. The plants are dying, the rats in the field and the other animals that are living out there start coming to where the people have, you know, stores of grain or rice or whatever. And that's near where people are living. So now you have people who are hungry ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Weaker immune system.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>... possibly immune sort of compromised, meeting these filthy desperate animals like rats, who are carrying microscopic friends. So I'll let you guess what happens next.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>God. Plagues.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>The plague. All kinds of sicknesses.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>All kinds of sicknesses, yes, but especially one. So they call it Justinian's Plague. This is 541, so five years later. This plague spreads basically across all of Europe. It's commonly estimated to have killed tens of millions of people.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow. I'm trying to sort of construct a composite reality from all of these things. I mean, it must have been cold as hell.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>There's rats and bacteria.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah. So these two geoscientists, Stothers and Rampino, they basically, like, comb through all of, like, anything written around that time all over the world to try to find, like, who talked about this and what did they say? And here's some of what they found. So this is a guy from Italy, statesman-y type person, Cassiodorus Senator. He says, \"The sun seems to have lost its wanted light and appears of a bluish color.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>\"We marvel to see no shadows of our bodies at noon.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Oh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>\"The moon too, even when its orb is full is empty of its natural splendor. We've had a spring without mildness and a summer without heat.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>That is bad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah, that's bad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>That's really vivid.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And so vivid. The loss of the shadows?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Like, you feel the cold.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Here's&mdash;here's another one that's, like, equally vivid, I think. So this is Mesopotamia. So this is around the area where Syria is now. A guy named Zacharias of Mytilene&mdash;probably pronouncing that wrong. \"The winter was a severe one, so much so that from the large and unwanted quantity of snow the birds perished. There was distress among men from the evil things.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Oh my gosh. Wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>What do you think the evil things means there?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I don't know. I just left that in there because I did not know what that meant. And I was like, ooh, that's really dark and sinister.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow. But everybody, the entire globe is suffering through a 15-month winter.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Unclear if it's the whole globe, but much of the northern hemisphere, for sure. But in Mayan history, there's this period. So this is the classic period of Mayan history, then there's this little mini-period that they call the classic period hiatus. And they have&mdash;the Mayan people would make these special decorative stone pillars to, like, mark history and what is going on in history at that time. Basically, they just pause making them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>What do you think the&mdash;okay, we kind of talked about what it felt like temperature wise, but like what do you think the world sounded like during these years? Or this year?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Well, I guess with the birds dying, probably quieter.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Mm. Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>But what's left is&mdash;I don't know. I imagine, like, walking on dried grass. Like, that kind of sound, maybe? Like, you know, the little scurrying of the rat feet over the fallow field or whatever.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And then wind probably picks up if you don't have trees, lush plants to break it, right? So you probably get, like, [whistles]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Do you know what I keep thinking about? Is any singular human in this moment would be thinking about their own sorry state and their family and maybe their village.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>But that would be the sort of circumference of their awareness. They had no big picture. So, like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I doubt anybody had a big picture of it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Right. But I mean, we can see that it was a global catastrophe. And we see that about our own moment in a way that they couldn't. So I wonder if it would have felt like the worst year ever. So it's funny to think that, like, the awareness of the whole magnifies the misery and, like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Or the awareness of the whole maybe makes you feel less lonely about it. Like it's not just you.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, that's interesting.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>I don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I wonder if there was someone who just, like, got on a horse and was like, \"I'm gonna ride until, like, ...\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>\"I'm out of it?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>\"I get the sun back.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And then they just kept riding and they never got back.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Totally come out of the cold and then, like, never gets there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, I guess what&mdash;I guess what I keep thinking about suddenly is&mdash;given that I'm an old man now it's my sort of inherited birthright to complain about young people. There's just such a fixation on mental health amongst, you know, kids, right?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And I think \"Thank God. That's amazing.\" But at the same time I think, \"Wow, your lives are so great.\" You know what I mean? But then I think, does it feel great? Probably doesn't. Like, objectively, their lives are so much more comfortable than a life would have been in 536.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>But maybe by virtue of the expanded awareness that we all carry things don't feel good, you know? And so I guess that's what I was thinking about was like, what if we endured 536 now, right? Like, what if a comet and a volcano blew up? Can you imagine the wall-to-wall CNN and the tweeting and the retweeting and the constant, like, sharing of misery? It must feel like&mdash;it would feel like misery amplified in a way that it probably hasn't at any other time.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But the sharing, yes, there is misery amplified and that but, like, think about when the Italians made that video for us. Do you remember that?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Oh, that singing and cheering and ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>This little message in a bottle of, like, take it seriously. Learn from us. Stay inside for a couple of weeks. It felt like that was a moment where the cross-planetary awareness allowed our best sides to try to come out.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And let's work together. Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And let's work together. And, like, the kind of watching how different leaders approach it, and then being able to just look back and see what works. And then take strategies and make mistakes and learn and ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>The sharing and the solidarity allowed us to way more quickly collaborate.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I mean, yeah. That is true but, like, okay, like, think back to 536, right? Probably most people alive on planet Earth at the time believed that what was happening, the horrors that were befalling them were coming from above. They were an act of God or gods. And then now what's going on, so much of what's going on, it feels like it's happening because of us. Like, something we're doing to ourselves and to each other. And sort of whether it is or not, like, it's like lab leak or China virus or South Africa variant or this person's not wearing a mask or that person didn't get a booster or whatever it is, and as much as the solidarity and stuff, like, that stuff also gets amplified on Twitter. I don't know. So it's like as much as you have the we're-all-in-this-together stuff, you also have the, like, it's all this person's fault. Let's scapegoat this person.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah, that's true. I don't know. I'm big on the solidarity in the long run making it better. And it just seems like with all of that, I mean, it's just like, I'm officially stopping bitching about 2020. Like, I'm done.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>[laughs] But does it make&mdash;okay. Okay. So that's sort of like&mdash;that's what I was sort of curious about. Does this&mdash;does knowing that people in 536&mdash;I mean, it's like, does it make you feel better about the last two years to know that in 536 it was a much worse year?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>It doesn't make me better so much as it makes me think, \"Oh, like, there are more floors to fall through here. Like, we could fall. We have longer to fall.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Like, I don't know if that makes me feel better to know that, but it definitely makes me not feel worse.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Okay. Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Because I'm saving the worse feelings for when&mdash;if and when it does get worse.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>That's fair.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>I just wanted to say what I&mdash;what you have left me with about knowing about that year, I just feel grateful I can go see my shadow.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And, like, that's what I'm gonna take the year ahead. That's what I'm gonna take into the year ahead is, like, well, if I can see my shadow, that means there's enough sun to just enjoy the basic warmth of that. And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And there's ground beneath me that is not lava, yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>That's not lava.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So going into the next year, at least we've got shadows and bread and ground to stand on.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. Do you guys remember my question?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>That was&mdash;that was last year.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>I know. It's old time.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yes. Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But do you remember what I got a little hung up on?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Music.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Or I just couldn't ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>You were excited to see ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>So before we leave you, one more thing. Because after Latif hit us with the horrors of that year, I was left with this question that just kept eating at me. So a little while later I called them both back up to add just one last little postcard from the year 536.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>What was your question specifically? Was it: did the misery create a new genre, or ...?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>I mean, my question was really just what was music like then? You know, what kind of music were people making and hearing that would have carried them through?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>What did it actually sound like?</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[phone rings]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So I did a little digging ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>Hello?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Hello!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And I found someone who had a pretty interesting answer to that question&mdash;at least for one corner of the world.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Should I call you Cantor Sayum? Mogus?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>No. No, it's Mogus. Mogus.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Mogus.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So Mogus Sayum, he's a cantor in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Lives in Virginia now, but grew up in Ethiopia. And some of the musical traditions of his church, songs he sings literally every week ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>... he says come from right around the 536 time, in what was the Kingdom of Axum.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Only by the way ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And in fact, he told me about one particular guy ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>From Yared. Do you know Yared? The Yared histories?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>St. Yared, who according to tradition was the person writing all this music.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>1,600 years ago.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Now we don't know the extent to which the dust veil of 536 affected this area, and there is debate over the historical person Yared, but according to Mogus's tradition, it was right around the year 536 that Yared composed a brand new book of hymns called \"Mawaset\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>And what are the songs in that book about?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>Mawaset? Mawaset is when somebody dies you sing songs of Mawaset.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>It's like a book of&mdash;it's songs for the dead?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Could&mdash;could you sing me just a little bit so I could hear?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, right now? It's okay?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>Okay. [singing]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Now again, it's impossible to know exactly how the chronology of these songs line up with the year 536, and also even how much of Yared's story is real or apocryphal. But what does seem likely is that if you were to walk into a church in Ethiopia about 1,500 years ago, and you were mourning someone ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>[singing]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>... this is the kind of music that may be sung to you to honor that loss.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOGUS SAYUM: </em></strong><em><span>[singing]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Wow.

And now it's all solved and everything's great. It's all over. Terrific.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Not quite.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>The pandemic just won't leave us.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Right. I mean, some of it was not our fault. I mean, some of it was our fault as a human species, some of it was not our fault. But regardless, as we've been looking back on this year, the second one in a row that has felt like it hurt. Like, it started with so much promise and we're ending with a whimper. We've realized that, you know, this year has been a flop. It's been a flop of a year.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. So here at Radiolab, as this crappy year comes to a close, we decided to pay homage to the flop itself&mdash;this very common and yet very seldom celebrated human experience of flopping.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So without further ado, we bring you &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Not just one, not just two, but ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Six flops.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Six flops.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Flops that are in the ocean.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Flops that are on basketball courts.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>I'm not sure he got hit in the face.

Six flops of various shapes, forms and velocities. Hoping that, as we flop our way to the end of the year, it might be nice to flop with others.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>And it might give us a little insight into what's on the other side of a flop.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANNIE MCEWEN:</em></strong><em><span> Are you in pain?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So who has our first flop?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU GNANASAMBANDAN: </strong><span>I have it. It's me. [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Hello. Who are you?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>Hello. My name is Sindhu Gnanasambandan.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Welcome!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>Thank you!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Whatcha got? Where are you taking us?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>We are going back to the early 2000s. To this show American Idol.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Of course.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>Which was one of my favorite shows growing up.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>And, you know, you probably know how it's set up. It's pretty simple: contestants go in front of these three judges, sing a song. Sometimes they're great. Sometimes they're really not.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>And the performance that I remember most from the show is actually one of these flop auditions. And that's the one I'm gonna tell you about.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>So this flop happened in September of 2003.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Paula Abdul: </em></strong><em><span>Hello.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, William Hung: </em></strong><em><span>Hi.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Paula Abdul: </em></strong><em><span>How you doing today?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, William Hung: </em></strong><em><span>Oh great, thank you!]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Paula Abdul: </em></strong><em><span>You're doing great?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, William Hung: </em></strong><em><span>Great to see you guys.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>This skinny Chinese guy wearing black pants and this blue short-sleeved shirt walks on stage.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Simon Cowell: </em></strong><em><span>William, why are you here?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, William Hung: </em></strong><em><span>I'm here to sing to America.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>Answers a few questions from the judges ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Simon Cowell: </em></strong><em><span>What are you going to sing?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, William Hung: </em></strong><em><span>I would like to sing Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs.\"]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Simon Cowell: </em></strong><em><span>Fantastic.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, William Hung: </em></strong><em><span>I hope you all enjoy it.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Paula Abdul: </em></strong><em><span>Okay.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Randy Jackson: </em></strong><em><span>All right, let's go.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, William Hung: </em></strong><em><span>All right.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>... and starts singing.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, William Hung:</em></strong><em><span> [singing] Talk to me, tell me your name.

I probably just laughed with everyone else but, you know, watching it now, it really just makes me sad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>What is sad about it?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>I mean, I think why he was so laughed at was because he sort of fit this, like, nerdy Asian stereotype.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>And, like, I grew up in this place that was filled with people who were Asian American and, you know, just like a very immigrant community.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>And as an immigrant watching TV and, like, especially a show like American Idol, it's sort of this way to answer this question of, like, how am I supposed to be here? Like, what is liked, like, what's good, what's lovable?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Totally.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Mm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I feel that so hard. Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>And American Idol is the cleanest version of that because you literally get someone just like going and being themselves and then three people being like, \"That was good. I liked this, I like what you're wearing. I like how you talk. I hate this!\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>\"I don't like this.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>Yeah, exactly.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>That's so funny because it's like an American Idol, it's like your American paragon of what it is to be an American.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>Right. Right. And, you know, William Hung ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Didn't fit the part.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>Right. He didn't fit. And, you know, I thought when this whole thing happened, you know, when America essentially told him, \"William Hung, you don't belong,\" I thought he'd just, like, disappear. But he sorta did the opposite of that.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, William Hung's coming!

You know, I was the kind of kid who if I got one answer wrong in class, I wouldn't want to go back the next day. And this guy was, like, going back to school, jumping on the desk and just, like, shouting the wrong answer again and again and again. It's like he's immune to being humiliated.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>And I've always wondered, like, how? How did he manage to respond this way? So ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SINDHU: </em></strong><em><span>William, how's it going?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>Good!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>I called him up.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>Just a moment, let me fix my background.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SINDHU: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, sure.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>He's 39 years old now.

And he said it's not like he grew up wanting to be a performer. He moved to the US from Hong Kong when he was 10 and had a really hard time fitting in.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>You could say that I'm more of a loner. My best friends were my teachers.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>He got bullied in middle school.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>Probably just because I'm Chinese or Asian, because I was the only Asian in my class.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>And college wasn't much easier.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>I didn't know how to make friends socially.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>But then one day he's walking into his dorm and this poster catches his eye.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>A picture of a guy with a microphone, the red curtains behind it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SINDHU: </strong><span>And it's this poster for this talent show that his dorm's holding.

And then my master teacher called me out, and, \"Step aside. Like, I'm taking over, da da da da,\" right? It wasn't&mdash;it wasn't a good scene. It was&mdash;it was an embarrassing scene to me.

I was ready to graduate. I seriously considered taking on a high school teaching position after I was done. But after that experience, that changed my mind. It's like, \"Okay, I don't want to go through this ever again.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SINDHU: </em></strong><em><span>Hmm. Yeah. I mean, I guess that makes sense that that feels more like a flop because I guess with a flop you need to have a ton of expectation and hope and, you know, you have to care a lot. And then you have that crushed with, like, a huge disappointment, like a total failure. And I guess this experience you had as a teacher does fit that definition way better.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, I agree.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SINDHU: </em></strong><em><span>But the thing is, like, for me, there's like one more component to the definition, which is like, the audience. Like the group of people who are watching you fail.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah. Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SINDHU: </em></strong><em><span>And to me, like, that's almost everything. Like, it would matter so much to me that American Idol was in front of millions of people. But you don't seem to weight that component very much. And I just like&mdash;why do you think that is?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>Well, like I mentioned, for my American Idol audition I just focused on having fun, enjoying the moment. And that's it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SINDHU: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah. But well, I guess another way to ask this, like, so the story we're making right now together, it's actually like the first ever story where my voice will be, like, a big part of it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>Oh!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SINDHU: </em></strong><em><span>You know, millions of people will be listening to this. And that's really scary to me. Like, you know, I guess I'm asking you all of this from a place kind of of wanting to learn from you: how do you not let the fear of judgment from all those people&mdash;and really for you not&mdash;I mean, not just the fear of it but, like, the actual judgment&mdash;how do you not let that totally crush you?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>WILLIAM HUNG: </em></strong><em><span>Ooh, I like this one.

He's a biomechanics researcher at Southern Methodist University.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXANDRIA: </em></strong><em><span>So you just opened your email one day, and it was just like, \"Mark Cuban.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, one evening I was like, \"Oh!\" And I showed it to my wife and was like, \"Does she think this is really Mark Cuban?\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXANDRIA: </em></strong><em><span>[laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>And she said, \"Yeah, I think it is.

At the time, he was a graduate student in Peter's lab. And so he and Peter got together, thought about it and they were like, \"All right!\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>This'll be fun.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>We have the equipment, we have the tools, so let's do it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>Absolutely.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SOREN: </em></strong><em><span>All right. So what did you do?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>We crashed into each other over and over and over again.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>We played human billiards.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, exactly.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>The idea was if they could figure out what a normal, non-floppy collision looked like, well then they could spot when something fishy was happening. So ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>We set up big crash pads in the lab.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>They'd bring people in. They put, like, the little sensor things on them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>We have a motion capture system.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>They got the cameras and they just have people run into each other.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>Well, to do that ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>Smack, smack, smack.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>In a whole variety of ways.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXANDRIA: </em></strong><em><span>Oh, my!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>Subjects of different sizes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>Like, a little guy runs into a big guy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>With different incoming velocities.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>You try it really fast, now you go really slow, or you just push on 'em.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>\"Well, what are you doing today?\" \"Oh, we're just putting on some, you know, video game suits and running into each other the whole day.\" Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>They even built a metal and plastic person. They called it Gus.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>Gus, he was just a galvanized structure with a piece of plywood in the middle.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>To, like, knock him over.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>I wanted to put a San Antonio Spurs jersey on Gus, but the members of the crew said, no, that's pushing it too far.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>So they do all these tests and here's what they come up with: guys falling on their butts all the time, that's not actually a reliable sign of a flop at all. If a player has their feet planted and their weight on their heels or whatever, it doesn't take much force to knock them over.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>It's not much. It's not much at all. If they don't move their feet, bam, over they go.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah. Absolutely.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Huh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>So that's gonna actually happen a lot in the natural course of a game. But the thing you need to watch, according to Peter and Ken, is the arms.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>All of the excessive upper body motion.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SOREN: </em></strong><em><span>The histrionics, yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, the histrionics, really.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>The natural reaction when you're hit and falling backwards is for you to take your arms and reach backwards to brace for impact. And so if a player's flailing with their arms above their head all crazy &hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>Nine times out of 10 ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>... that's probably a flop.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>... they're putting on a show.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>The problem is even that doesn't really help much because a guy could actually get fouled and sort of flail his arms just to, like, draw attention to it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>Right. So they write this whole report up. They even made like a video, and they gave it back to Mark Cuban. And this was not what Mark Cuban wanted to hear.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>He was hoping for more&mdash;something more concrete and actionable to sort of stamp out this epidemic of faking. But, you know, we can't change the science.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So this whole experiment was itself kind of a flop?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>[laughs] Well I mean, yeah. Maybe a little bit. But the interesting thing was that Peter and Ken told us that a scientific, hard science, spot-the-flop kind of thing actually might be possible in the not-too-distant future.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>It's not far-fetched to think that we could have instantaneous velocity on all 10 players on a basketball court at any given time.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>And all you would need is just like a tiny little bit of math.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>You know their mass, you know mass and velocity, you know instantaneous momentum. You go off some basic assumptions that momentum in a collision's gonna be conserved.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>Then you just have computers that are sort of tracking and crunching all those numbers.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>Based on the sizes and velocities incoming and outgoing.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>And if there's more momentum coming out of that than going in ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>You just send a little signal down to the ref right there on the court.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>Beep beep. You know, bell goes off in the ref's earpiece and says, \"Hey, that was a flop!\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXANDRIA: </em></strong><em><span>Then just like, [buzz]. A big old like X. Like, that was fake.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>[laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, and then they just put it on the big screen, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXANDRIA: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SOREN: </em></strong><em><span>Like Family Feud when you get it wrong.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXANDRIA: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>Right. That's right. [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> To think that someone like Mark Cuban would spend his infinite amount of dollars to find out the core cause of flopping instead of why his team can't win a championship again seems to be a bit of a waste of money, don't you think?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>Okay, so after talking to Peter and Ken about what they did, we were kinda letting ourselves imagine&mdash;at least in theory&mdash;the game without flops. So we decided to put this idea in front of my friend Tyler Tynes. He's a sports writer at GQ, and I was like, \"Tyler, like, what do you think?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> I don't think anyone in this country, if they have any sense about themselves, would look at you in your face, sit down and tell you they enjoy flopping. But flopping is part of the game. It has always been part of the game.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>And he was kinda squishy on this.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> Well, I think the thing where I come from is that flopping by nature is sucker shit. It is naturally detestable.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>So he hates flops, but at the same time, part of the beauty of the game for him is just letting players play it however they're gonna play it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> And so the issue actually isn't with players, the issue is with the league that incentivizes this type of entertainment. So if Trae Young or Draymond Green or Marcus Smart flails a bit differently than maybe some of our heroes of old, the reality here is that it makes money when you flop. The teams are better if you flop and you can get a three-point shot.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>We have incentivized sports in America to be like win win win win win by any means necessary, but flopping is by any means necessary.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> And so is the core of this actually the players?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>Well, but if&mdash;you could decide whether the system is gonna incentivize a flop or not, right?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> For sure.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>You could change the system so it doesn't incentivize it. And I'm just kinda curious, like, would you rather see a game with no flopping?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> No.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>And actually we heard the same thing ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>PETER WEYAND: </em></strong><em><span>No. It just doesn't feel right to me, you know, having grown up playing basketball.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>SOREN: </strong><span>From both Peter Weyand and Ken Clark.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>KEN CLARK: </em></strong><em><span>No, I don't think so. Not in my mind.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> I don't like adding police officers to the sports that I watch. You know what I mean? Like, we have changed how we talk about basketball, and flopping and the policing of flopping is a part of that, where the way&mdash;like, how you identify who a basketball fan is now has changed. Who enjoys basketball? Who runs these teams? Who now are the presidents of these front offices?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> These are white kids who wanted to be Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, and never could. And now they have the cultural cache and the power to say what is important within our athletics. And it is how we get to something as serious and non-serious as flopping. Where it should be just a part of the art form. It should just be fun. But instead it's become policed. Now you're a bad player if you flop. Now you don't care about the art of basketball if you flop. Now, even for someone like me, I'm calling these people out they name because they flop, right? It's not the trueness of how we believe basketball is supposed to be played. And so to me at least, the issue is that why don't you just care if these boys is playing basketball or not?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXANDRIA: </em></strong><em><span>I hear you. [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA: </strong><span>It's interesting because when I came into&mdash;when we started working on this story, my feeling about flopping was pretty much centered around James Harden, notorious flopper. And he would look so smug about it and it would just grind my gears, and I would just be so incensed by it. So when we started working on this, it was really a moment for me to sit and think about, like, what kind of basketball game I actually want. And so I arrive at this place where I'm like, flopping just feels like it's just part of the theater and the drama of, like, what makes watching a game so exhilarating.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> Watching James Harden ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXANDRIA: </em></strong><em><span>Oh my God.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> ... figure out how to be an insurance salesman with these flops.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXANDRIA: </em></strong><em><span>[laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TYLER TYNES:</em></strong><em><span> It was kind of magical because you knew he was going into the game and had no care about the rules of the game.

We kept coming back to the scene of the crime: The White House.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT: </strong><span>If we just go back. Let's go back to, like, the early&mdash;like, the formation of the White House.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXIS COE: </em></strong><em><span>When Washington first took office, the White House was an idea that they would get to.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>HEATHER: </strong><span>So at first when Washington was president, he lived ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXIS COE: </em></strong><em><span>In New York.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>HEATHER: </strong><span>And then in Philadelphia.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT: </strong><span>But he knew that there needed to be a permanent residence for the President.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXIS COE: </em></strong><em><span>A presidential house, as they would call it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT: </strong><span>And his big thing was, whatever they end up building ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXIS COE: </em></strong><em><span>... there can be no markings of monarchical rule.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT: </strong><span>Like, no gilded doors and a big arched gateway.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HEATHER: </strong><span>He was like, \"I'm Mr. President.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HEATHER: </strong><span>It's not a presidential palace.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT: </strong><span>Because the idea is that the government, the democracy is supposed to be of the people, by the people, for the people.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXIS COE: </em></strong><em><span>But Washington was in a tricky situation because he liked the finer things in life. He liked sumptuous fabric, plush suits, purple carriages.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>HEATHER: </strong><span>The example Alexis gave us that's, like, excellent for this very thing is for his inauguration ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXIS COE: </em></strong><em><span>He orders a simple, home-spun, brown suit. But if you look down at his shoes, he's wearing diamonds.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>What?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HEATHER: </strong><span>Shoes with diamonds on them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>No!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>What?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEXIS COE: </em></strong><em><span>He's wearing diamond buckles.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Wow, G.W.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT: </strong><span>And so, under Washington, what we ultimately end up with for a president's home is definitely not a palace, but it's also&mdash;I mean, it's a mansion. When it was built, it was the biggest house in all of DC.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HEATHER: </strong><span>It's like a conflicted, confused space all the way through.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Mm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HEATHER: </strong><span>You know, the White House is built by enslaved people. The first handful of presidents besides Adams are all slave-owners. They're like fancy Southerners who are trying to, like, figure out how to also be democratic, which is like, these are like the primordial problems of American democracy. Like, who gets to be inside of it and who's not inside of it? It's like all the stuff that's kind of like baked into the formation of the country is also baked into the formation of the White House.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT: </strong><span>And so, this is where it gets kinda fascinating because, for example, both the House and the Senate have rules for dress code. Like, they have dress codes, they have rules for decorum. Like, the White House doesn't have anything that's codified.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Interesting.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT: </strong><span>And so what the White House becomes is this space where in each administration they can sort of dictate what the White House ought to be, and kind of like demonstrate what they think our country should be.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HEATHER: </strong><span>You know, it's played out in, like, what Christmas trees the First Lady chooses and how you know ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. I was immediately thinking about that. Melania's trees.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>HEATHER: </strong><span>Yeah.

And I think even then, like, people mostly knew that HIV couldn't even be transmitted that way.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>DAVID: </strong><span>Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Like, the pool was so big, the water was chlorinated.

There is one part of it that feels like a fair question to me, and that's, like, when I think about the doctor, right? The guy who was stitching up Greg's head, he wasn't wearing latex gloves, and so he was stitching him up. Like, if he had pricked his finger with that needle, he&mdash;he could have contracted HIV.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>To me, that moment, that&mdash;that is very morally complicated.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GREG LOUGANIS: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah, one of my fears was, you know, well, what is my responsibility knowing that I'm HIV positive?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.

I had my face down, and I didn't have eyes on the top of my head. And that's just it: you don't know what you don't know.

Okay, there were no latex gloves. Okay, that's not in my control. And so it's basically letting it go.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>After we talked to Greg, I just&mdash;like, I kept thinking, like, he's&mdash;he's right. There's nothing he could've done about the accident, nothing he could've done about the doctor not wearing gloves. But I did keep thinking, like, he did have control over whether or not he told the guy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>DAVID: </strong><span>Yeah, but you're making it sound so simple. Put yourself in his shoes. Put yourself in his Speedo.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>DAVID: </strong><span>And think about what just happened, all that's at stake.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>DAVID: </strong><span>You know, when he came out as HIV-positive and gay, I'm relieved and feeling like I'm not the only one who's thinking about this kind of thing. I think me and HIV-positive people around the world&mdash;because I tested positive in '87, a little earlier than he did.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>DAVID: </strong><span>And I got this job to sing at Tokyo Disneyland, and I needed this job really badly. And I was very familiar with that list of countries that you're forbidden to enter. And Japan is on there too. And I'm coming into Narita Airport outside Tokyo in this very formal, very polite English but Japanese thought kind of sign. It says, \"Hello. If you are HIV positive, please step over here and register.\" And I remember walking under that going, \"You have gotta be kidding me. I am not saying a word.\" So when I'm hearing Latif go back about \"What were you thinking at the moment,\" well, you kind of think about that moment every day of I'm in the kitchen and I'm having dinner with friends and I cut myself and what do I do? I'm not gonna announce to everyone I'm HIV-positive, but I'm gonna make sure I clean it up, run it under water, get it bandaged up and have my heart stop pounding. So to zoom in on \"Did you make the right choice in that moment when you're getting stitched up?\" is an understandable question but I mean, think about all the secrets you gotta keep because you have to keep them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>The part of that that I, like&mdash;yeah, that I, like, really hadn't considered was this feeling that it's like this one moment however, you know, highly public it was, it was just like one moment in a string of so many moments like this.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>DAVID: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>So I guess to end the story of this moment, what happened next?</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, sportscaster: </em></strong><em><span>They checked him over.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>DAVID: </strong><span>Okay. So Greg finishes getting stitched up, and he goes to talk to his coach.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GREG LOUGANIS: </em></strong><em><span>He said, \"You know, you can pack up, you don't have to get back on the board.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>DAVID: </strong><span>We could just go home.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GREG LOUGANIS: </em></strong><em><span>But I was in fifth place. I turned to my coach and, you know, said that we've worked too long and hard. He said okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>DAVID: </strong><span>They're not gonna go home. They're gonna keep going.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, sportscaster: </em></strong><em><span>He will continue in the competition.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>DAVID: </strong><span>So he gets back on the board.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, sportscaster: </em></strong><em><span>He has two dives remaining.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GREG LOUGANIS: </em></strong><em><span>I heard an audible gasp from the audience.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DAVID: </em></strong><em><span>I remember watching it, and I just held my breath for you to take that next dive.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GREG LOUGANIS: </em></strong><em><span>Yep.

One into the water and one out of it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Lulu. Radiolab. That was me flopping. It's a flop show. Flop show! All right. Our next flop comes to us from ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL CUSICK:</strong><span> Flippity floppity.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Flippity flop.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. Producer Rachael Cusick.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Okay, I'm gonna start this by telling you about a time when I didn't flop but I wished I had.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Oh, the flop that got away!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Exactly.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>All right, Rach. Please explain.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Okay, so last summer I was in Utah with a friend, and it was just brutally hot.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TAMAR: </em></strong><em><span>It was so hot that we were in a parking lot, and the temperature read 114 degrees.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>That is my friend who I was with. Her name is Tamar. And Tamar being Tamar, she went onto Google and found a public pool for us to go to. So we drove a few towns over, put on our bathing suits and walked out on the deck.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TAMAR: </em></strong><em><span>And it's clearly like the place to be on a day like today. Pool noodles slapping the water and, like, all this laughter.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And the centerpiece of it all was the diving board. Now Tamar is, like, immediately giddy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TAMAR: </em></strong><em><span>These are my people, the people at the diving board.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>She leaves me behind and gets in line with ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TAMAR: </em></strong><em><span>A range of six year olds to 12 year olds.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>She got onto the highest diving board and jumped. And she just looked so happy. Like, so perfectly carefree. But that's not how I felt at all.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Why?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Growing up, I just was the one in my family who was the heaviest and in my friends who was the heaviest. And so as I grew up, the pool was where I was at my most vulnerable. Like, there wasn't any hiding from clothes. And so I kind of trained myself to be as small as I possibly could at the pool. So that day in Utah, I'm at a crowded pool of strangers, and I'm like, \"How can I get myself in that pool as fast as possible but also, like, as quietly as possible?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>I'm, like, looking at the pool, searching for the corner furthest away from the eyes at the diving board. Like, the cool lifeguards, they were off to the left. I gotta, like, stay away from them. Meanwhile, I was 25 years old. I am, like, a great person. Like, I should not be strategizing away from the lifeguard in the bucket hat, but that's where we were that day.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And then I see that there's, like, awkward kids in the corner. So I head their way. I looked both ways to make sure no one's watching me, and then slowly, carefully, like I'm putting a potato into a pot of boiling water, I slink my body into the pool.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So it's just disappear?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Totally.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TAMAR: </em></strong><em><span>You know, this entire time, Rach, just so you know, were just kind of like bathing with all of your body submerged except for your shoulders and your head.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHAEL: </em></strong><em><span>[laughs] It was like an alligator.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>TAMAR: </em></strong><em><span>You looked kind of like just&mdash;not sad, but just let down. I feel like almost you shut down in a way.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>And she was right. Like, I felt defeated, like a kid who got bullied by myself.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah, that's not good. That's not good.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>It wasn't good! So&mdash;so that was what happened back in July.

And I didn't even know why. Like, I'm staring at these videos of belly flops the way that you stare at your fridge when you're really hungry and you don't even know what you need to eat.

It's of these manta rays that jump out of the water and then they, like, kind of sail and then they plop down like a pancake.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>YOUTUBE CLIP: </em></strong><em><span>The higher they leap, the bigger the bang.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>These manta rays and their belly flops, they are the opposite of me in that pool last summer.

[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Oh God!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>RACHAEL: </strong><span>Yeah, I think there's gotta be a PSA announcement at some point. [laughs] My entire front of my body is popped blood vessels.

She thinks it's fine. And I just need to take it easy the next few days.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>All right. Thank you, Rach. Thank you, Dad. I think. And for our final flop, I'm gonna flop us right on out of the water onto land. It is time ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>What does that mean?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>I mean, it's time to look at a fish flopping around awkwardly on land&mdash;a fish flop.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay? All right. So you know this is kind of ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>I don't&mdash;I don't think I've ever seen this before.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>No, I don't think I've seen that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay. Well, allow me to conjure it for you. Picture a beautiful, scaled creature lying on a dock, trying to move. Heaving up and flopping down. And heaving up and flopping down. Getting nowhere, you know?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Like a last gasp kind of thing.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Exactly.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And I think since the first time I saw it, its just been burned into my brain as the saddest, most pathetic movement in nature. However, a few weeks ago ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>[singing] Rolling on up on the Shedd Aquarium.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>... I met someone who watches fish flopping ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Thank you for bearing with me.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>... almost every day.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Great to meet you.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHEL ZAK: </em></strong><em><span>Yes, you too. I know!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And she completely reframed how I see it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHEL ZAK: </em></strong><em><span>My name is Rachel Zak, and I'm a senior aquarist on the special exhibits team at the Shedd Aquarium.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Oh. Hello, turtle!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So Rachel walked me around all these massive tanks of clownfish and sharks.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHEL ZAK: </em></strong><em><span>And I'll show you the ribbon eels.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Sea dragons and pufferfish.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>He looks like a grumpy frog.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And first of all, she explained that every species of fish has its own little distinctive flop.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Would an eel flop? Or would it just, like, wriggle like a snake?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHEL ZAK: </em></strong><em><span>Oh no, they&mdash;they flop.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And the thing that really holds them all together is that none of them, none of these flops are what she would call pathetic. In fact, when she sees a fish flop, she thinks ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHEL ZAK: </em></strong><em><span>That's an awesome behavior! That's exactly what they're supposed to do.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>... it's part of how they survive.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHEL ZAK: </em></strong><em><span>Flopping is effective. Like, a fish that you drop on a pier flops enough to make its way to the end of the pier.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALICE GIBB: </em></strong><em><span>I mean, there's an achievement there. So there's a real&mdash;there's skill. There's technique. There's just a ton of power.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>It's just flailing, right? Like, how much technique is there?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Well, the voice you just heard is Alice Gibb, a biologist at Northern Arizona University, who for the last decade has been filming fish flopping on desks in her lab.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALICE GIBB: </em></strong><em><span>So let me tell you about flops.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>She filmed all different kinds of species, and when she played the videos back in slo-mo and watched what's really going on inside that motion, she saw that the fish is doing something that seems impossible.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALICE GIBB: </em></strong><em><span>Have you ever watched somebody dribble a basketball, and they start it flat on the ground and they tap it just gently? And if you tap it and tap it and tap it, you can start the ball bouncing up and down in bigger and bigger and bigger arcs.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>So the fish somehow ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALICE GIBB: </em></strong><em><span>... bounces itself.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And at a certain point, they kind of jerk up onto their tail.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALICE GIBB: </em></strong><em><span>It's almost perpendicular to the ground at this point.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And then they launch forward, often into the water.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHEL ZAK: </em></strong><em><span>Fish didn't learn to flop because we dropped them on decks, right? Fish learned to flop for many different reasons.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Grunion, which is a kind of fish, actually flops out of the water for their babies' sake. So they'll, like, flop up onto the sand, lay eggs so underwater creatures can't get them and then flop back down into the water.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHEL ZAK: </em></strong><em><span>They're rock stars.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Or there are other fish ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHEL ZAK: </em></strong><em><span>Killifish.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>That flop because they live in these tiny little pools, and sometimes there might only be one in a tide pool.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RACHEL ZAK: </em></strong><em><span>And the males, they need to find females to breed with.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>And they'll just kind of flop, like, 10 times the length of their body into another pool.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALICE GIBB: </em></strong><em><span>In a human-centered world when people talk about \"I flopped down on the couch\" or something, seems to imply maybe an uncoordinated movement that then is followed by no movement at all.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALICE GIBB: </em></strong><em><span>Right? Like, it sort of implies that you've hit a dead end.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LULU: </em></strong><em><span>Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALICE GIBB: </em></strong><em><span>But that's not what's going on with the fish on land, right? Because even the flops, which I think are called \"flops\" because they appear uncoordinated, they have the ability to maybe take something that could be a dead end and turn it into another chance.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>But like a fish flopping back into the water, like, how often could that possibly work?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Okay, well, probably not that often.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>But sometimes! But not that much.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Yeah. But you know&mdash;well, the thing it makes me of ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Mm-hmm?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Is like, when you think about us, like, we were ocean creatures at the beginning before we became land creatures. And for us to have gotten to the land at all ever, like, that was probably the first way it happened. Like, we're only possible because of fish flops. That there was this moment, there was this pivotal fish flop without which we would not exist.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Boom.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Right?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>Yeah. Yeah, that's beautiful. We don't need to say anymore.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF: </strong><span>Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LULU: </strong><span>All right.
