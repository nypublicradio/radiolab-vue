Over the last year there has been a cascade of headlines about scientists trying to use AI to translate animal languages into a form we can understand. At this very moment, brilliant scientists and sophisticated algorithms are trying to decipher the snuffles of pigs, the honks of geese, the squeaks of mice, the barks of dogs, the caws of crows, the moos of cows, the clucks of chickens, the chirps of fruit bats, the meows of cats and the songs of sperm whales.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Those are just the ones that have been reported in the last year or so. But turns out, people have been trying to listen and talk across the species divide for way longer than that. Today we bring you a Radiolab story originally broadcast in 2014 about what is, I would argue, the greatest and most shocking of these stories. And what's even better is it's told by a human in the first person, someone who was right there. Might not be appropriate for younger kids or more sensitive listeners, but with that warning here you go. \"Hello\" from Radiolab [squeaking]. That's how you say \"enjoy\" in dolphinese. I think.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[RADIOLAB INTRO]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN LEVY:</em></strong><em><span> Hello, this is Lynn.

And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> The balcony was flooded too?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> The balcony was also flooded.

So this all kind of sort of comes from this guy John Lilly, who was a scientist, a researcher starting in the '40s.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> A total Right Stuff physics major kind of guy out of Caltech.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Man's man, according to Graham Burnett.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> I'm a historian of science.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> But then, according to Graham, John Lilly has this epiphany.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> During the Second World War ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> At the time, people just weren't thinking that much about dolphins in general. Like, there was not this idea that they were sort of extraordinary beings. They were just like big dumb fish. You know, they were shot for sport.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So John Lilly is doing this research about brain mapping, and he ends up working with dolphins. And one of the&mdash;the story that he's told goes that he was experimenting on these dolphins, and as he's working with them, you know, kind of like shoving things into their brains, they make noises. As would anyone. And when he listens back to the noises which he's recorded, it sounds to him like the dolphins are trying to speak to him.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> To say something to him in&mdash;not in a&mdash;not in a dolphin-y way, but in a human way. Like, trying to speak English to him.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> What does he say the dolphin was trying to say to him?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I don't think that we know that, but it sounded to him enough like human speech that he thought, like, something's going on here. This is important. According to Graham, he said later that it made him realize, like, we're ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> We're not the only intelligent organisms out there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Like, we have company.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> That maybe humans are what happens when high intelligence evolves in an animal that also has hands, and dolphins are what happens when comparably, if not still more extravagant intelligence evolves in an animal without hands.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> What do hands get you?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> Well, hands basically get you an appetite for punching people in the head.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> I&mdash;you know, it makes us tool-users, but the distance between, you know, the hammer that you use to knock open your coconut and the hammer that you use to knock open the head of that other Cro-Magnon you were never that keen on is, in fact, zilch. There's no difference at all.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And by the time we get to the '60s with, you know, like, peace and love.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> It was exciting to think that the dolphins and the whales have these huge brains, but they don't, like&mdash;they're not after anything.

They're just, like, being, man.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And keep in mind, this is on the verge of the Vietnam War, where you have all this anxiety about ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Jim Morrison:</em></strong><em><span> [singing] What have they done to the Earth?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... overpopulation, environmental destruction.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Jim Morrison:</em></strong><em><span> [singing] What have they done to our fair sister?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So very quickly, the dolphins become like this vision ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> Of how we might ourselves be so different than we'd come to feel we were, tragically.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So John Lilly was one of the first people to get swept up in all this. He quits his government job, moves to the Caribbean and sets up this lab ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> John Lilly's Communication Research Institute.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... to try to talk to dolphins. Which is where Margaret ended up.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> And my feeling was this: that everybody was talking about how bright they were and how smart they were, and it was dolphins, dolphins, dolphins.

Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Her bed was on this kind of wooden platform in the middle of the apartment.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> I was maybe two and a half, three inches above the water.

But towards the end, things kind of started to unravel. First of all, there weren't really results from this experiment. They never were able to publish any scientific papers. And there were other problems. Lilly got very involved in drugs. Especially ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> LSD. He did bring it down. He did give LSD&mdash;he says he did, I believe him&mdash;to two of the dolphins. I would not let him give LSD to Peter. I wouldn't allow that.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Why would he give them LSD?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well, it's not a hundred percent clear, but it seems like he was trying to find a way to get the dolphins to open up, to connect. Maybe to talk. In any case, by 1965, '66, his funding had started to dry up. And when people heard about Margaret's work, they tended to focus on, like, one particular part of the story.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> You don't have to answer, but a lot has been made of your sort of sexually engaging with Peter. And I just want to ask&mdash;because you don't seem like a shrinking violet&mdash;I just want to ask, is there anything you want to say about that?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> Um, what would I like to say about that? I think the sensational side of it is ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Here's what Margaret told me: Peter was a young dolphin, he was horny and he would hump her leg a lot, kind of like a dog might do, which was getting in the way of their work.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> So eventually, I just said, \"The heck with it.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And she'd use her hand to, you know ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> And&mdash;and it would quickly satisfy him, and then we could go back to doing what we were doing.

People didn't want to be associated with Lilly. Nobody wanted to fund anything that sounded like Lilly. It just got this, like, aura of ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Don't go there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... don't go there. Even people who wanted to do really rigorous work with human-dolphin communication had a tough time getting any funding. And that lasted for a long time. And the thing is, even though there are so many reasons to disapprove of this experiment, when you talk to Margaret you can't help but want to be in that apartment with them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> He would come over, and when he was in what I call his sweet mood&mdash;and Peter had a lot of very, very sweet mood to him&mdash;he would sink to the bottom and take my foot in his mouth. And he wasn't sonaring, and he wasn't looking at anything. It was almost like a little kid comes and just wants to hold your hand, and he would just sink to the bottom and close his eyes and just hang on to my foot. And then he'd have to come up and breathe and then he'd go back down. And he'd just grab my foot. And he would do this for a good while.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> We'll be back in a moment with another encounter.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> I'm Robert Krulwich.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> This is Radiolab. And today ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Hello.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Yes!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Or as a dolphin might say ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> How would a dolphin say it?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> I don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Well, then&mdash;but you know what? That is exactly kind of the question of this next segment. I mean, the dream that a human being can talk to a dolphin, or any animal really, get in their heads, cross that gap ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> This is a dream that humans have had for since, like, forever.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Yeah. St. Francis of Assisi. Goes way back. Now insofar as dolphins are concerned, after the John Lilly situation, researchers did get a little tepid.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Yeah. But they didn't stay tepid, as you say, for long.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> No.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Because along came this woman.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Dr. Denise Herzing. Director of the Wild Dolphin Project.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Who basically decided to take John Lilly's experiment and flip it. Rather than have the dolphin speak English, let's have the human speak dolphin. Or at the very least, let's create a shared language where humans and dolphins can speak.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Or at least whistle.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Well, you know, it's about finding&mdash;finding a place you can meet.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Back to producer Lynn Levy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Okay. So for Denise, this dream of finding that meeting spot, it goes back to when she was a little girl.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Well, when I was 12 years old, I used to page through the Encyclopedia Britannica in the days when we had books.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Mm-hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> And I would always stop at the whale and dolphin page, look at the dolphins and go, \"Wow, I wonder what their brains are like? Because they've evolved in the water.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> You were thinking that when you were 12?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> I was. I was&mdash;I was a total nerd. In fact, I entered this contest in Minnesota, like, \"What would you do for the world if you could do something?\" And I actually wrote, \"I would build a human-animal translator so we could figure out what was going on in the minds of animals.\" So yeah, I don't know. I got the bug early and here I am.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT:</em></strong><em><span> Were you having a fantasy about what you might learn? Or ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> A fantasy? No, I was just curious. So I don't know, you look in their eyes, there's definitely something behind there. You just want to know what it is.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Fast forward many years. Denise got a boat.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> And I went out to the Bahamas.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> She was like, \"If I'm gonna study these dolphins, I'm gonna do it in the wild.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> That's where they live.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So she tracked down a pod of wild dolphins.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Yep. Yep.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And she just tried to blend in.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> I actually anchored the boat in one spot most of the time.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> This spot in the Bermuda Triangle.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> The middle of, I call it, \"The dolphin highway.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Where dolphins come and go.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> They could come by if they wanted to. And if they didn't, they didn't.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> When they would come by, she and her team would just slip into the water.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> And behave ourselves.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Just sort of watch. Paying attention to who was who, which dolphin had a crooked fin, which one didn't.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> And when they'd leave, we'd get out, and that's really how we operated for the first five years. And it worked fine.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Five years? She spent five years just watching? Not doing anything else?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Yes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Doesn't this take an enormous amount of patience?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Well, sure. I mean, but after about five years they started realizing, well these guys aren't gonna grab us and poke us and prod us. So they started just going about their own business.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Like feeding, mating ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Nursing ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... and talking.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Or at least making a lot of noises.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Which she and her team would record.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Wow! That's all dolphin squeaking?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well, dolphins make&mdash;they make all these&mdash;yeah, like that. There's like a clicking, kind of creaking sound that they make.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh, sounds like a zipper.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Zipper. Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah, they make, like, whistles that are more kind of distinct, and then they make sounds that are, like, longer and weirder. And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> And do you have any sense that each of these sounds means something different?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Well ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> That's exactly what we don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> ... I could tell you what kinds of sounds are correlated with fighting and with mating or disciplining a calf. What we don't know is are there detailed kind of words in there? Is there more kind of encoded information?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> But what they do know is that each dolphin seems to have its own kind of signature whistle.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Which is basically a name. Every individual has its own name.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> Peter had a name. Nobody's ever asked me that.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Here's Margaret again.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> And his name was ... [imitating dolphin sound]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Really?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> It was almost saying, \"Peter here.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Right. So I can call you \"Lynn\" by your whistle, and you \"Robert\" by your whistle.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT:</em></strong><em><span> So I could be a dolphin going [imitating dolphin], Lynn!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Exactly.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Do they do that?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> They do.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Not only that, apparently dolphins will use the names of other dolphins who aren't even around. Like, they can't see them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Like, they'll talk about each other behind their backs?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yes, maybe.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Wow! That means that they're using representations of things which aren't in front of them, which is sort of like the beginning of language.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> If that's what they're doing&mdash;and we don't know&mdash;but if that's what they're doing, then yeah, that's kind of like the edge of language.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> So, you know, it gives us hope that there's probably more information going on there than we know.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And now finally, she has that device.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Which device again?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> The magical, you know, human-animal translator device that she was dreaming of and writing about when she was 12.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Ah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> She has this box that can generate dolphin noises and it can recognize dolphin noises. And if it works the way that, you know, that she's dreaming it will work, it could be the first, like, real two-way back-and-forth conversation between a human and a wild animal.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> So we're looking forward to the summer and getting out and getting more data and really exercising the boxes and see what happens. Good, we're ready.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So I begged my way aboard.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Everybody good? Seasick pills for tummies?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> We left on July 8 from Florida and headed for The Bahamas to see this pod that she's been following kind of forever.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Almost 30 years now.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RADIO:</em></strong><em><span> I just saw Stenella.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> The boat is called the R/V Stenella.

And if they do call her name, this name that she's made for herself, then the box should be able to recognize it, and can tell her that she's been called by name.

So she gets into the water over and over, and she says, you know, have the equivalent of, \"Hi, I'm Denise. Hi, I'm Denise,\" over and over and over. And they learn it. You know, they develop this ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh, like maybe they'll just start to use it and call her.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> So you hope&mdash;you hope they call you.

For a while I was on this boat I was like, why is this so hard? Like, seems like it should be&mdash;these people are so smart, like, this should be easy, but they're just like constantly being defeated by the ocean, basically. Which&mdash;and the ocean is like a worthy foe. But it's like the first year ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> First year was a complete disaster trying to get the hardware to work.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> What happened the first year?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Everything broke.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> It was leak city. Basically, the boxes just kept shutting down as soon as they would get in the water.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> [laughs] That's not good.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> It's not good. That's sort of not what you want.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> No.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And last year ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> We had the boxes working, but then we couldn't find the dolphins.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> The dolphins just disappeared.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT:</em></strong><em><span> Where did they go?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> You know, they went a hundred miles away to another location.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> They don't know why.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> I kept up with my side of the deal, Denise.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> I know, I know!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Your dolphins stood you up.

[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> [laughs] Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Like, wearing like my shorts and like a bra. And I had like, all modesty aside&mdash;like, thrown aside. They were like, \"You can go in.\" And I was like, \"Okay, okay, okay! Go on.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Jesus Christ, here I go.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> We'll be right back.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> I'm Robert Krulwich.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> This is Radiolab. And today ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> The show's called \"Hello!\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Back to Lynn.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I mean, it's a total sensory shift. The temperature changes, everything goes quiet. It almost feels like this, like, classic Through the Looking Glass moment where you&mdash;like, you go through the looking glass and, like, everybody's walking on the ceiling.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And I jumped in, and there were two pretty big dolphins coming right at me like maybe two feet from my head, and staring at me. And I was like \"Uh, I don't know what&mdash;I don't&mdash;\" [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> What did you do?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I stayed very still. I pretty much froze.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> And how far were they from you?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Two feet.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh my God!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah, yeah. Dolphins are not small, and they were looking at me in a way that was like, \"We see you.\" And also, they're&mdash;they make these ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... sort of clicking sonar-y sounds which are, like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Do you think they were talking to you, or just talking about you?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well, no. And I mean, what I think they were doing is ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... is sonaring me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh, I see.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Sort of looking at me with their&mdash;with sound. I mean, my head was vibrating.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Whoa!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I mean, they can see not just body shape, they can see your bones.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> They can see into you. Like, you really feel looked at.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> It was heart stopping.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> That was un[bleep]ing believable! [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> That's what I was waiting for.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, that was so cool!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> At that point I was like, the trip could end now and I'd go home happy, you know? And everybody was like, \"Calm down. Those weren't even the right dolphins.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> What do you mean?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well, those were bottlenose dolphins. Denise studies spotteds.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> But the next day ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> All right. Onward for spotteds.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Spotteds or bust.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... we set out again. Go for a few hours. Bethany does this dolphin dance.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BETHANY AUGLIERE:</em></strong><em><span> Me being energetic. Spotteds!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Oh! Got some.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> You saw him, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, right there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, there we go. Gotta be spotteds, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So then everybody's like&mdash;you know, it's like all-hands-on-deck situation. Everybody's, like, strapping on the boxes and strapping on headphones.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> What are you doing?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh, so there's a lot of scrambling.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> There's so much scrambling.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, there's one off the bow here.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> It's like a fire&mdash;it's like a fire drill. Now ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> I'm putting on my box.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... here's the problem.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> I'm just testing.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Unlike a captive dolphin, wild dolphins, they have other things to do. They have, you know, fish to catch. You kind of have to entice it into having a conversation, otherwise it'll just swim away. But how do you do that when you don't know its language? Well, turns out dolphins are just crazy for scarves.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Scarf high, scarf low.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> When you throw them a scarf, they sweep it up with their tail fin, and then they let it go and it wafts through the water, and another dolphin comes up and sweeps it up with their rostrum. So the idea is you use the scarf as kind of like a bridge. Denise and another diver will get in the water with a scarf.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> We'll get in the water and we'll just start ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Passing it back and forth.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Human to human.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Like, \"Hey, look at this fun thing we're doing.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Let them watch. If they want to get in the game, we let them in the game. Sometimes we'll take the toy over to them, show it to them and press the word for scarf. [whistle] Say, \"Hey this is a scarf.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> They just made up a whistle for \"scarf?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yep. And ideally&mdash;and this is the key&mdash;the dolphins will pick up the word and use it too to ask for the scarf. If and when they do that, then you've got, like, a tiny bit of common ground that you can build on. Okay ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Who you got?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> We have four spotted dolphins.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> Our little candidates Sisten and Pallet.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Yes, you've been waiting for them, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> We have!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Just before they jump in, Denise walks another diver through the game plan.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> Oh.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> So you're gonna hold it and you're not gonna give it to him.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> Okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> You're gonna entice it with him. You're gonna be like, \"Oh this is so nice.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> Should I like, dive down with it and, like, wave it? Or ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. First start at the surface, and just really get them with you.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Moments later ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> All clear?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Good. We're ready.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... Denise jumps in, followed by three other divers.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Four in the water.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Were you in the water this time?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> No, I actually had to watch the whole thing from the deck. And, like, you could see from the surface three or four adolescent dolphins.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RESEARCH ASSISTANT:</em></strong><em><span> See? Denise is right up next to one of them.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> You see the back of her head and her little snorkel.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, that's good. She's surrounded right now.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> What are they doing?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> I'm not sure.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, they're kind of like twisting around each other.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I will say this: she is tremendously graceful in the water. She gets in the water and she's, like, totally at home.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> So maybe she is a dolphin?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> She might secretly be a dolphin.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Going, like, around and around. There she goes under. Man, what is happening under there?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> This is what it sounds like underwater.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> This is the actual sound from this scarf dance?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> They record everything that goes on under there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I mean, a lot of that is the dolphins just doing whatever they're doing. But some of it is Denise with the box making this scarf whistle over and over like, \"Scarf! You want the scarf? Yeah? Scarf?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Because she's, like, trying to get the dolphin to say the word, right?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah. Eventually, she and the dolphins surface, and ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> He's got the scarf right there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Oh! Ah, he's got the scarf!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... one of the dolphins is holding the scarf.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Hey!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> It's like this flash of red.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Yep.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And then they all go back under.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> And if Denise comes back up with it, that's real good.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> All right. Wait and see.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> After about a minute, she surfaces.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> I think Denise has it now.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> She dives one more time.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> A minute later, dolphin has the scarf. And this went on and on. They were passing it back and forth so fluidly that I thought maybe the dolphin has begun to ask for the scarf by name. Eventually, Denise gets ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Gravity sucks!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... hauled back up onto the boat. And we all just sort of gather around like, \"Well, well?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, the two juveniles picked up the scarf right away, and we played some signature whistles and played some scarf whistles and then some sargassum came floating by.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Piece of seaweed.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Showed them that, played the sargassum whistle.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> You think you got the name in?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Nothing that triggered the system. But, you know, we'll see what it looks like. Whew! It's exhausting.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Wait, she didn't get anything?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well I mean, nothing the box recognized as a match. You know, nothing that indicated the dolphin, like, learned a word.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Aww!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> But it's like they were right there!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> But there was this one thing that happened: she said that when she addressed one of the dolphins by its name, the dolphin turned around and looked at her and kind of cocked its little dolphin head.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yes.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh! I so was hoping that you'd say that!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh, wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Also, there was this moment where Thad and Celeste were looking at the data later.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Who is that?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And they saw that right after Denise made her signature whistle ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Is that somebody responding with her signature whistle?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... another dolphin made its signature whistle.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Sweet!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>CELESTE:</em></strong><em><span> Whoa! That's pretty cool.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> You mean, like, she said, \"Hi,\" and it said \"Hi\" back?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> That's amazing!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well, maybe. I mean, the thing is dolphins make their signature whistles all the time.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So it could be nothing. Or it could be this moment. I mean, she's a very rigorous scientist. Like, she wants that to happen another 30 times.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Before even starting to take it seriously.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> But still, it does make you think about the possibilities.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> What do you want to ask?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, I don't know. I want to ask everything, so ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Like what?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Well, I'd like to know what their lives are like when we're not around. I mean, how do you spend your day? You know, do they think about things? I mean, do they think about the future? Do they think about the past? I mean, we know they have long-term memories. You know, do they remember their calves from 10 years ago?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Do they think about death?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, they certainly see it. Could be anything you'd ask your friends, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Hmm. Although part of me wonders, like, are they ever gonna even get there?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> What do you mean?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Well, if the goal is to have a conversation, and you're gonna do it this way where you're in the wild and you can't touch them and you've gotta verify every whistle 35 times, well are they ever actually gonna have a conversation?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Well, but it's like day one of the language lesson.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Yeah, I get it. But, like, don't you feel like Margaret was&mdash;all the problems with that experiment aside, she was actually getting somewhere with Peter? Like, they were actually having a real exchange?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> In the moment, perhaps. But thinking forward, I believe that what you can accomplish by talking, by having a two-way conversation, is just infinitely greater.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> And I totally agree, but if it's taken her 30-something years to get to a maybe hello.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> She doesn't even know if she got to hello yet. And if all she has is just a limited amount of time with these dolphins every summer, then 50 more times is gonna take her 50 more years. And I'm just like, oh God, the planet is gonna be 17 degrees warmer by that point. Dolphins are gonna have all migrated to some other spot. It just feels like, oh, come on! Just get in the pool and hold&mdash;let the dolphin hold your foot.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> [laughs] She's already got the hello going for her, maybe, so that's like a start. And then, yes, in 50 years, she may have moved past hello to ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> A three-word sentence.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> \"How's your mackerel today?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah. I think that, too. A three-word sentence, yes. I would put money on a three-word sentence in 50 years. The question is, do we ever get to the point of ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Exploring death?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Yeah, I don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Lynn, do you have faith?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Hmm. I have faith that if Denise continues with what she's doing, that we'll be able to talk about concrete things. We'll be able to talk about seaweed, and we'll be able to talk about coral, and we'll be able to have a scintillating conversation about scarves. I do believe that. And that is not nothing. I mean, that is pretty impressive in its own way.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Big thanks this hour to our producer Lynn Levy.

Today, we have the second installment in a series where we just sort of let ourselves fall into a conversation between our own senior correspondent Molly Webster and a scientist who's working on the front edge of something, if not exactly news, something deeply and delightfully new. So here we go.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[RADIOLAB INTRO]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> I don't know about you, but I found being a teenager and, you know, going into puberty, very difficult. You know, I was bullied by the mean girls, the popular girls at school and had to eat lunch by myself. And I remember having a tearful conversation with my mother and she was, like, Don't worry. It'll pass. You think that this is the whole world right now, but in a few years you'll be off in the bigger world and you'll see that there are a lot more people and you'll fit in better and it'll be fine.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLLY WEBSTER:</strong><span> I'm Molly Webster. This is Radiolab and that was G&uuml;l D&ouml;len</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a neuroscientist and former teen. But unlike maybe the rest of us former teens, G&uuml;l's very familiar teenage struggle would end up at the center of her scientific work and lead to new ways of seeing the moments in our lives when our most basic habits and behaviors emerge&mdash;and then get locked in. And it all starts with something called critical periods.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Okay, so for, like, us, you know, yokels over here, like, what is a critical learning period?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, so critical periods are windows of time when the brain is especially sensitive to its environment, and it can learn really well and really strong from that environment. Probably the best way to understand that is to think about the first critical period that was described. I think a lot of people have heard of it. It's imprinting behavior in geese. So this is ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> So cute. We did an episode on it at one point.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> So yeah. So Konrad Lorenz, what he noticed is that within 48 hours of hatching, a little geese will&mdash;goose&mdash;well, gosling, I don't know ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Gos&mdash;goose. Geese.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Geese.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> I don't know.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Anyway ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Geese will form a long-lasting attachment to whatever is moving around in their immediate environment. And so typically this is their mom, but if the mom isn't there, it could be another mom. Or if it's, you know, Konrad Lorenz, it could be a scientist. But then after that 48-hour time window is over, they can be exposed to all kinds of things in their environment and they won't form that lasting attachment. So that little window of time where they're so sensitive to their environment and they can form this lifelong attachment is what he coined the phrase, critical period.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> And when was that discovered?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> So that was in, I think, 1935. And then since 1935, we've discovered dozens of other critical periods.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Wow.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> There's critical periods for language, there's critical periods for vision, there's critical periods for touch, for, you know, motor learning. There's&mdash;there's critical periods basically for everything that the brain has to learn that isn't encoded in your genes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> And do we associate those critical periods with being a baby?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yes. Mostly it's&mdash;I mean, not just babies. There are, you know, different windows depending on what you're trying to learn at the time. So, you know, vision, the critical period peaks around three or four years old. By five or six, it's closed. Language, it stays open probably six, seven, eight, and then it's closed. Motor learning is a little bit longer because you're still learning a lot of motor things pretty far along. And then, you know ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> It's so funny. Like, neuroscience often makes me feel like I just started falling behind at, like, three months old. Because you're just like, oh, that window closed, and that window closed, and that window closed. I'm like, I'd like to think I'm 40 and the world is still my oyster, but&mdash;but perhaps not.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, well, I mean, I&mdash;definitely, when I've talked about this with some people, they get a little offended because they're like, \"What do you mean? I'm open minded. I'm open minded and I'm 40.\" And it's like, yeah, you're open minded, but you're not a sponge the way that a child is a sponge. Right? Like, if you've ever watched a kid try and get out the door on a snow day, it's brutal. You know&mdash;like, they are noticing everything. It's like, \"Shoes? What shoes? Look at this dust bunny!\" you know.\" Every single leaf is like a magical kingdom full of possibility. And they're just noticing it all. And so, you know, they need to close because it's not&mdash;it's not very adaptive to&mdash;to be always in that open, vulnerable state forever. And if you're trying to make your way through a sabertooth tiger-infested area, it's probably better to be, you know, habit-based, efficient, you know ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> And you're like, \"Oh, look at the flower!\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Right.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> \"Oh, look at the butterfly!\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> \"I love your tooth. It's awesome!\" Right. Like&mdash;but the ability to reopen critical periods has been something that neuroscience has been looking for for almost a hundred years, because we realize that, you know, the reason that we're so bad at curing diseases of the brain is because by the time we get around to fixing the underlying problem, the relevant critical periods have all closed.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Wow, this is, like, creating such a feeling of, like, urgency in me.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLLY:</strong><span> So critical periods are great for learning and learning fast. They make us super spongy and absorbent to the world around us. But the fact that they close makes it hard to relearn something we've lost or unlearn something that's getting in our way. But G&uuml;l, in her first lab at Johns Hopkins University, actually uncovered a whole new way of thinking about that problem. And weirdly, it all comes down to peer pressure.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> My postdoc, who had studied very early brain development, was really interested in studying, you know, how social behavior changes over maturation. And he was like, \"What if critical periods is the basis of this change in peer pressure behavior in juveniles versus adults?\" And at first I was like, \"That's kind of a boring project.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Really?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> And he was like, \"No, no, I really want to do this development thing.\" And then I was, like, \"Well, you know, I do&mdash;I do remember being bullied as a teenager. You know, maybe there's something here.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> You were peer-pressured into peer pressure?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, basically. Yeah, I mean, it was just to take it back a second, I mean, part of the reason that I think I've gone back and tried to interpret why did I struggle so much with fitting in when I was in middle school? And, you know, if I really think about it, it's because when I was younger I was so obsessed with being in the right in-group and knowing the exact right shade of acid wash jeans that cool kids were wearing. And I had this idea that maybe we care so much more about who's in our social group and our social environment because we're learning from our social environment much more when we're younger than when we're older. And so that was sort of my own personal intuition about why there might be such a thing as a critical period for social reward learning. But of course in the human literature, they can't do, you know, a comprehensive study of, you know, one type of social behavior across 15 different ages, you know, looking at hundreds of people at each age. It would cost way too much money. But I knew that we could do that kind of experiment in mice.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLLY:</strong><span> So G&uuml;l and her team, they get a bunch of mice at all different ages, and they observe them very very closely. And she basically confirms sort of what we see anecdotally in humans: that teen mice pay attention to their friends more. They learn from their friends more. But then they opened the tiny mouse brains, and what they saw is that mice, just like humans, have oxytocin, this sort of feel good chemical released around friends or loved ones. And they saw that the neurons in the teen mouse brains were more susceptible and sensitive to oxytocin. And so it seemed like oh, this is a biological neurological critical period.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> And then right away we were like, \"Okay, we need to figure out a way to reopen it.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Wait.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> So &hellip;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> They reopen?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yes. And that's interesting because one of the earliest ways that people figured out that you could reopen critical periods was deprivation. And so visual deprivation, for example, can reopen visual critical periods, auditory deprivation can reopen auditory critical periods, sensory deprivation can reopen touch critical periods. It's just not a very clinically useful way of doing it, right? Like, it's just not ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, I was like, \"How long do I have to be deprived?\" Molly's over here looking at her calendar. \"Like, what do I want to fix?\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. And so we were&mdash;we were looking around for different ways to reopen it. And we knew that MDMA was a psychedelic drug that was special and different from most other psychedelics because it had this ability to induce prosocial behavior. You know, kids were taking these&mdash;these drugs going to raves doing, you know, 60 person cuddle puddles. But also that ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Love a cuddle puddle.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, I mean it is&mdash;it's a very powerful&mdash;powerful drug. And it does have these very profound effects on people. So then we thought, well, if MDMA is able to induce a massive release of oxytocin, which&mdash;there was some evidence from other labs showing that&mdash;we thought maybe this would be a really cool way to reopen this critical period by triggering this massive oxytocin release that could prepare the neuron to learn from its social environment again.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLLY:</strong><span> So they go back to the lab, back to the mice, who this time are gonna go on a little trip.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> In this experiment we were giving the MDMA and then waiting for two days. So they're no longer actively tripping, they're no longer actively cuddle puddling or doing anything like that.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Would you, like, peek in with, like, a secret telescope to&mdash;to see what their behavior was like in those two days?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> No. We could have, but we didn't.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> I don't know if you've seen people on psychedelics, but unless there's a DJ, you know, they can look very boring on the outside, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> I mean, I'm not sure. Maybe the mouse got acid-washed jeans or something.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Unbeknownst to us.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Little ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> So no, it wasn't like that. Basically what happened was&mdash;is that then they had a \"How much do you care about social interaction\" quiz, essentially. Like, we tested them on, \"Can you learn from social group again?\" So we say, \"Okay, here's two new types of bedding, and we want you to tell us which one you like better by how much time you spend</span></em> <em><span>on them.\" And when we did that test&mdash;these were adult animals, but the ones that had gotten MDMA two days later, when they go into the bedding, it's like, \"Oh, I like this bedding because I&mdash;I remember that all my buddies like this bedding and that's where I found my buddies is on this bedding. So I like this bedding, not this other bedding.\" Right? When they received the MDMA in a social context, with their friends, suddenly they all cared, right? Like they suddenly&mdash;they were learning from their social environment again as if they were teenagers.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLLY:</strong><span> And what G&uuml;l and her team saw is that these adult brains on MDMA went back to that sensitive teenage-like brain state.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> So can I tell you what we were wrong about there? I don't know if I told you this or not.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Oh my God, sure.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, so at the end of that paper in 2019, we were like, \"Okay, great. We understand this now. It's because MDMA is prosocial.\" But we also knew that MDMA belonged to this larger group of compounds that are all psychedelic, right? And so I was like, let's just test it with LSD. And suddenly all of the animals who had received LSD were also doing social reward learning like they were juveniles again. And I was like, \"Okay this is weird, I don't understand why this is.\" Because, you know, nobody's doing LSD and then, you know, doing a 30-person cuddle puddle. You know, people who do LSD don't have this, like, acute prosocial effect that MDMA has, right? So it's&mdash;that's strange. Let's test a couple of others in case. So then we did it with psilocybin, and we got the same thing. And then we were like what about, like, ketamine? And it did it. And basically all of the psychedelics are doing it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Like, the fact that it's a drug that induces social behavior is not why you're seeing social results. It's about the ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Right.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> ... it's about the class of drugs, of psychedelics.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> That's right. That's right. It's the psychedelics part of it, not the prosocial effects of MDMA, that make it able to reopen this critical period.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> You know, when I first started working on psychedelics&mdash;so this was about 10 years ago&mdash;the fad was, \"Look, everything cool that psychedelics do you really have to study in a human. There's no way that you're ever gonna be able to get at that mystical experience, that&mdash;what does a mouse seeing god even look like? You know, you're just not going to be able to&mdash;you're just never gonna be able to get to the heart of the cool stuff if you study it in animals.\" And I think that this critical period explanation is the first one where we can really challenge that worldview. And what I think is that this&mdash;this seeing god, this mystical experience, is really just what it feels like to reopen critical periods.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLLY:</strong><span> And just to put that in context, it's like a dude tripping in a corner is, in a way, having the same experiences like a wide-eyed baby soaking up their world or a teenager who cares so much about what everyone else thinks of them. And it's not just that they're experiencing in the same way. It's that there's an underlying deep biological mechanism that's being shared in all of those situations. And if you can tap into that mechanism there are some very real world, practical things that you might be able to do, which we'll get into right after this break.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLLY:</strong><span> I'm Molly Webster. This is Radiolab. We are back in the saddle with neuroscientist G&uuml;l D&ouml;len. She has been telling us about how psychedelics can reopen critical periods in the brain. And where it goes from here in a way just gets more practical because I think we've all been hearing about studies in which psychedelics are curing various afflictions. So it's like MDMA is helping with PTSD, or psilocybin, aka magic mushrooms, can help with depression. And G&uuml;l says that she thinks her study, the one that she did with mice, that it might be able to provide a clue about how those treatments are doing what they do.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> If we gave MDMA in a social context then it was able to reopen the critical period, but not if we gave MDMA in an isolation context. So in the case where they were by themselves having MDMA, they did not reopen their social critical periods. Context matters, right? It's not like people are going to Burning Man and just having a dance party and coming back cured of their PTSD. It's the right&mdash;if you give MDMA in the right context. So if you pair MDMA with therapy, then you get these remarkable results.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> That's very interesting, that in a way it's not the psychedelic that&mdash;I mean, it is the presence of the psychedelic is allowing something else in the brain, like an experience or whatever, to have an action.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> So let me just unpack that in two different ways, because I do think this is, to me, where the crux of the debate right now is. I think there's sort of ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Who knew? I'm settling in. Okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> You're settling in. So the crux of the debate seems to be, you know, what I call the biochemical imbalance model of psychiatric illness and the learning model. And so the biochemical imbalance model, it basically says if you are depressed, it's because of a biochemical imbalance in serotonin. And all we have to do to make you undepressed is restore that balance, right? The problem is&mdash;is that that approach has only provided symptomatic cures, right? So people who are on SSRIs, you know, when they come off of them, they go back to being depressed. People who are on Wellbutrin, when they go off of Wellbutrin, they go back to smoking. And people who follow that model find that to be an acceptable solution.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> But the psychedelics, they have these remarkable results where people instead of taking, you know, one a day for years and years and years, the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy trials, it's three pills total. And those no longer adaptive habits become available for relearning, for updating to the current circumstances. And six months later, the underlying condition is resolved. So what people describe with psychedelics is it's like it was 20 years of therapy in one day. And I think that our critical period idea really provides an explanation. It's not just that something is happening at the receptor level that is rebalancing a biochemical imbalance. It's that that thing that's happening is enabling a reconfiguration of all of the synapses that are relevant to the trauma. And that is the cure. And that is the cure. It's the reconfiguring that's the cure. It's the learning that's the cure.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLLY:</strong><span> G&uuml;l says that when you use a psychedelic in the right context, it actually opens up the brain at a cellular level so that the neurons can reorganize themselves. And in that reorganization, they can create new patterns and new pathways that allow for learning and maybe even healing. So really what these drugs do is create a window of opportunity.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> How long was that period seemingly open for?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> This is probably the coolest part of this paper. There's this proportionality between the duration of the acute subjective effects of the psychedelics in humans and ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> AKA \"the trip.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> The trip, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> The length of the trip.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> The length of the trip is proportional&mdash;the length of the trip in humans is proportional to the duration of the open state that we can induce of this social critical period in mice. So, for example, ketamine keeps the critical period for, you know, two days and then, you know, by a week, it's closed. Psilocybin and MDMA keep it open for two weeks and then closed by three weeks. LSD keeps it open for three weeks, closed by four weeks. And then there's sort of a rock star psychedelic which most people haven't heard of called Ibogaine. And that, the trip lasts anywhere from 36 to 72 hours.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Wow! Okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> And Ibogaine reopens the critical period for at least four weeks, and we haven't tested the&mdash;the closure. We haven't found ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Because everyone had to, like, go home for dinner and you're like, \"We can't ...\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> \"We can't test this anymore.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Pretty much. [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> I mean, it's just sort of interesting because you think even four days&mdash;four days, two weeks, more than a month&mdash;like, are you just in those moments, like, vulnerable to everything? Are you like&mdash;it just feels like the next couple of weeks, like, solidly matter.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yes, solidly matter and solidly vulnerable. So it's possibly a missed therapeutic opportunity, but it's also possibly a time when we could do great harm to people because they're suggestible, they're sort of vulnerable to information coming in the way that children are. And then we've, you know, kind of thrown them back into their lives and possibly re-exposed them to whoever's been traumatizing them, and that we could potentially lock in some really bad things.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> It's funny. It's&mdash;yeah, I think about&mdash;I mean, recreational psychedelics use, people are doing it all the time, at least in my world. And like, now I just want to be like, \"Okay, for the next two weeks, if you could, you know, be careful, or maybe go&mdash;if you go take a yoga class, if you really want to learn that technique or something. I don't know. It's just the vulnerability part of it feels&mdash;and vulnerability is&mdash;it has such a negative connotation, but I do think it goes both ways of, like, it's just, you're vulnerable, you're malleable, you're open. That feels like a double-edged sword.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. To me, these drugs are extremely powerful medicines, and we need to treat them with respect. I, you know, really feel like if you see these drugs as powerful ways to restore, you know, that childlike sense of wonder and vulnerability, in the two weeks after you do a psychedelic, you should take care of yourself like you're four. Right? Like, don't expose yourself to anything that you wouldn't take your four-year-old to.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> You know, from my point of view as a neuroscientist, maybe these psychedelics are master keys for unlocking all kinds of critical periods that neuroscientists ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> What a crazy phrase, \"master key.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. Right? All we have to do to change which critical period gets reopened is change the context. So if you want to reopen a social critical period, you give it in a social context. If you want to open it in a motor critical period, you give it in a motor context, right? So maybe the rave is a great way to open a motor context critical period, but not necessarily an inner-directed PTSD kind of critical period.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Wow. Okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> But you know, when I first started talking about this master keys</span></em> <em><span>idea, people were just, like, rolling their eyes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, really?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. Oh, for sure. \"Your critical period is just a baby critical period. It's not like the serious, hardcore critical periods that matter clinically. You know, you're just&mdash;it's just easy to open because it's&mdash;the door isn't closed that hard on that one, anyway.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Because it's, like, social. Mammals are social.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. And we still care about social. It's just, you know, social, it's an emotion.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> What's, like, the hardcore critical period that would ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> So the hardcore one is vision, and since we first started making the case that psychedelics are reopening this critical period, there have been a couple of other papers from other labs showing that actually they can reopen&mdash;well, ketamine is the one that people have looked at, but I think there's now another paper out about LSD, suggesting that they can reopen ocular dominance critical period. So the visual critical period can also be reopened. But the most hardcore one is motor, right? So movement. And this is the one that matters for stroke. And just so you know, reopening this motor critical period after stroke has been, you know, a goal of clinicians and it's kind of where good ideas go to die, right? [laughs] Like, people have been trying to do this for stroke for a long time because roughly a million Americans a year get a stroke, and half of them are debilitated for life afterwards, right? They&mdash;it's just&mdash;it's just horrible. Five hundred thousand people a year are debilitated in the United States. And stroke is, you know, much more common in other countries. So it's a worldwide massive burden.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> And just real quick, why is motor neuron, like, the top of the mountain for critical periods?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> I mean, we don't really understand how it happens, but basically, what we think is that when the stroke happens, the brain region that is encoding&mdash;let's say it's a hand movement, that those neurons that are encoding that hand movement die.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Whoa.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> And neurons ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Die.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> ... in the&mdash;in the motor cortex are not able to regenerate. So once they're gone, they're gone. And so what we think has to happen in order to recover from a motor injury is&mdash;is that the nearby neurons that are encoding, say, the arm or the elbow or the upper arm, those neurons have to get repurposed and have to learn how to do finger, even though they're normally doing elbow.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Elbow. Hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> That's a hard thing because, you know, they've got a job already.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> And they've been doing that job for 70 years, potentially, you know?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> That's right. That's right. And so, that's why we think it's so hard.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> And right after a stroke, if you want to reopen the critical period again, so far the best way to do that is to give another stroke, which is not clinically useful, right? Like, nobody wants to cure stroke by getting another stroke.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> So the main thing that G&uuml;l's team is focused on right now is designing a clinical trial for stroke patients. What they know is that generally after a stroke, the critical learning window is open for about two to three months. And then it closes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> So, we think that after they've, you know, done as much as they can during that two months/three months after the stroke with the physical therapy, but they haven't recovered full motion yet, we can give them psychedelics and keep it open a little bit longer.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> And keep the PT going.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Keep it going. Actually, though, in the first version of this trial, what we're gonna do is we're gonna take people who had a stroke over a year ago. So their critical period is closed down.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Hard and fast shut.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Hard closed. And then we're gonna try and reopen in those people and see what happens to their ability to pair that&mdash;that psychedelic with physical therapy this time instead of psychotherapy.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Say your trial works, that you see that if you have a stroke and I give you MDMA, and for two weeks we do stuff and you can gain motor neuron skills back. That's great. But imagine that you don't gain all your skills back. So then you're like, \"Okay. Well, I'm gonna do MDMA again, keep the window open for two weeks, so I get a month out of this, right? Two doses. I get a month where I'm open.\" I'm wondering if you hit a point where the MDMA&mdash;your brain's, like, used to it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> There is evidence that there is only so many times that you can take these psychedelics before they stop working in this way. There's evidence ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Seriously?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> ... anecdotally from recreational users who estimate that you've got about 20 or 30 really big MDMA trips and then you're done, and it loses its magic after that.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, it's&mdash;it's like&mdash;makes me think that, you know, depending on how your stroke stuff comes out, that I want everyone to save at least one MDMA trip for themselves, you know, for when they're older.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>G&Uuml;L D&Ouml;LEN:</em></strong><em><span> Right. Right. Yeah, I agree. I'm hopeful. We don't know, this is, this is really&mdash;I'm speculating now, but if this is the case, maybe you use up all of your MDMA slots, but you've never done Ibogaine, and so you can still have an Ibogaine in reserve that could tap into to re-open. But, you know, this remains to be seen.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MOLLY:</em></strong><em><span> Hmm. I sort of want to run out of here, and I'm not sure if I want to do MDMA with a therapist or if I just want to do MDMA and cuddle with people for two weeks, you know, of if I just don't want to do MDMA at all. Like, maybe go hide in a cave for a while.

So as a whole new avenue that will have implications for, you know, people with cochlear implants, people with traumatic brain injury&mdash;you know, all kinds of other diseases that really right now we just don't have any therapy for.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLLY:</strong><span> This episode is reported by me, Molly Webster. It was produced by the amazing Sindhu Gnanasambandan. There was production help from me and Timmy Broderick, and fact-checking was by Emily Krieger. I want to give a huge thank you, shout out to G&uuml;l D&ouml;len, who is now at the University of California-Berkeley, and talked to me multiple, multiple times. Special thanks also go to Charles Phillip and David Herman, and a special shout out to Romain Nardou, who is in the lab of G&uuml;l D&ouml;len, is the postdoc we reference earlier in the piece&mdash;the one who said, \"You know, let's study peer pressure.\" Finally, if you want that spongy brain juice, you should check out our newsletter. It's got content, extra content, insider content, fun pictures, staff recs. You can go to Radiolab.org/newsletter and sign up, or check out the link on the show notes.

And the house was ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Fairly old.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, it was about 105 years old at the time.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Two-storey white house, nice little porch, awning over it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Typical farmhouse style.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> And so you were at your parents' home back in your old bedroom?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, in my old childhood bedroom. Yeah, so there was always a sense of, like, I need to get out of this house. It's holding me back somehow from things.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> So he got a job.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Worked a job and got laid off.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And one year turned into two. And then three, then four and then five.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> It was not a great time to be there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> In what way?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Just that I felt like I was still 16.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> He says he'd overhear his mom telling people on the phone ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> \"Well, he's never gonna move out, is he?\" [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And then she started circling classifieds.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Jobs for typists, printing press, sales rep, typesetter. I don't know. I think everything in my life, however I mean for it not to, sort of moves at my own snail's pace.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And eventually ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I was fairly old, like 27 maybe.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Actually, he was 28. After eight years in this house, Dennis gets a steady job, finds this cheap apartment.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> This ratty six-plex apartment.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> He starts packing up his things, but right when he's set to move out, to finally leave home ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> My mom got really sick.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Dennis's mom had been in remission from breast cancer for, like, nine years, but that summer her doctors told her that it had returned.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And had spread quite a bit. I said to her, \"Do you want me to be here or do you want me to go?\" And she was like, \"Well, if this is my time,\" she wants to go knowing that her kids can take care of themselves.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> So Dennis moved out. About five months later, his mom died.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. She went pretty fast. About a month or so after my mom died, my dad found out he had stage four prostate cancer.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> Wow.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And he was really too sick to take care of the house and just be the guy by himself at that point.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Now Dennis pretty much had to come home.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I'd take care of him ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Three, four times a week.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And as he got worse, he had said to me, like, \"Hey, let's try to find you a house to buy so that I can teach you how to do all of the kind of stuff that one has to do.

And before they could find something else ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> The cancer from his prostate spread to his brain and the last week of his life, he was really not there.

And he redid the bathroom.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And it turned out pretty good. It was kind of fun. And then the next thing I knew I was taking wallpaper off in the kitchen. That's gotta go. Hardwood floors, insulation in the attic, glass block windows in the basement.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Pretty soon ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> That turned into the whole house.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And how long did that take?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Five years.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Actually, it was six.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Wow.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And he says the whole time he was doing this renovation, at night ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I would have these dreams where my parents just kind of came through the back door, and it was just like, \"Oh, what are you doing here?

Two different people, two separate occasions, had come over to the house and they said they felt this weird presence.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And she was like, \"Wait.

Katie can describe her.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Katie:</em></strong><em><span> She had, like, long hair.

And so Brittany ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>[ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine: </em></strong><em><span>I don't know if I even explained to you what we do.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> ... who was like the ringleader of the night ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> She sort of explained how she does things. She was like, the best way that she could get them to talk to them was through flashlights.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Yeah. So what they do is they take a few flashlights, turn them on, and then they unscrew the tops of them just enough so that they turn off. And then they just kind of set the flashlights that are now off in the room by themselves. And the idea is that if the ghost or the spirit wants to communicate, they can just sort of touch the top of one of the flashlights with their ghost-y finger and that'll turn it back on.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>[ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine: </em></strong><em><span>It's barely connected. All they have to do is either push or pull a tiny bit of energy.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Katie:</em></strong><em><span> I see.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>[ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine: </em></strong><em><span>It's not that hard. It's obvious for them to do.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And I was like, \"Okay.\" And so she took three flashlights, and we all sat in this dark room in a circle. And ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Brittany sets the flashlights in the middle of the circle by themselves. No one's touching them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And she says ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>[ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine: </em></strong><em><span>If there's anybody in here, my name is Brittany.

Can you turn one of those lights on?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And they sit there and they sit there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine:</em></strong><em><span> Are you here?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And then all of a sudden this light kind of barely blinks on. And then she said, \"Okay.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine:</em></strong><em><span> Thank you.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> \"Please turn it off.\" And then it goes off.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine:</em></strong><em><span> What we can do with these lights here, is if I can ask them ...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And then she says, \"We have three lights here.

Are you scanning the room, looking for somebody who has a little switch or something?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. But, like, we didn't pay these people, so they have no reason to fake this, I suppose. But, you know, I just keep thinking, \"Well, the house is really close to the train tracks and maybe the train ...\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANDY:</em></strong><em><span> The vibrations of the train? Yeah, that makes sense.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> But all of a sudden they were like, \"Can you hear that?

And the reason is because for a long time, he didn't want to listen to it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Why?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Well, I think part of it had to do with this moment because ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> This was the point where my skepticism kind of kicked off.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And part of it had to do with what happens next.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>That's coming up when we return.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>This is Radiolab. Let's get back to Matt Kielty's ghost story.

And I don't want you to, like, stay here and feel like you belong here. I want you to go out and be free. Can you let go of this house, to finally move on? That's fine. I'm going to leave you guys.

Exactly like that. And I kind of teared up.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And keep in mind that this was the first time that Dennis had heard this tape, and so we played it back to him because we just wanted to see, like, how he remembered that experience.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> You know, I guess part of&mdash;part of my fear of listening to it was that it would change it, and that it would be a different experience. It would be a little more hokey and it would be a little more unclear what was happening, but listening to it again, it was as I recalled it being.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So in the end, does he believe he was actually talking to his dead parents?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> No. No. I ended up actually calling this guy who explained to me how this whole flashlight thing works, and that there is a perfectly non-paranormal explanation as to what's going on with the flashlight.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> It almost feels bad manners at this point to have a practical explanation, but I'm very curious to hear it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> [laughs] What's going on is you turn the flashlight on.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And when you turn the flashlight on the bulb gets really hot.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And then you take the top of the flashlight, and you unscrew it just enough that the flashlight flickers off. So the flashlight's off and the bulb, it got really hot so the inside of the flashlight also got really hot. And there's this little piece of plastic inside the flashlight that when it got hot, it expanded. And now since the flashlight's off, that piece of plastic, it starts to cool down and starts to contract. And when it contracts, it pushes these two tiny bits of metal together, these two little bits of metal come into contact. And that's your circuit. So the circuit opens, the light bulb, it goes back on.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh, then it warms again and cools again.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Then it gets hot, and so the little piece of plastic, it starts to get hot. It starts to expand and pushes the two pieces apart.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> And these people chose this flashlight because it had that particular property?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, do you think it's like a con or something?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. I mean, I even talked to Dennis about this. He's like, \"I think they're just trying to make sense of randomness. I mean, I don't think they necessarily know that this flashlight does this thing and therefore they can manipulate people.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Well, here's why I don't think it's a con, because in this case it's such a strange coincidence that whenever he wants his mom and dad, his ghostly mother and father to approve of him and congratulate him and honor him with a yes&mdash;I mean, it's random he could get a, no but he gets a yes.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> It's just chance.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And you told Dennis all this?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> [laughs] Yeah, I told Dennis because you told me to tell Dennis.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>That's true. [laughs] That's right, I forced him. Okay, so when you told him, what did he say?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Well, on one level, like, it didn't faze him. Dennis basically said, like, \"Look, I know ...\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I know that the way that the world works is the way that the world works. People don't come back from the dead. People don't talk to you through flashlights.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> But he also said that, like, he's not gonna let go of that experience. He wants to have it both ways.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I guess so. I guess I want to have both yes, this didn't happen and yes, this absolutely happened.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> I understand that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Because even if you are the world's biggest skeptic, if you don't believe in ghosts, like,there really aren't that many ways to talk about these sorts of things, these sorts of things that we all feel. You know, guilt for the things that we've done in our past, the loss of those who we've loved. That,like, ghost stories seem to stick around because they are an experience, albeit like a metaphorical experience, but an experience that lets us talk about these things that we can't adequately talk about. You know, that feeling of being haunted.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And so did he eventually sell the house and move out?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Yeah, sold the house, moved out.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>No more dreams of his parents haunting him.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Well ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> It's been odd in the time that I've sold the house now. I thought the dreams would stop. And now the dreams are that I am the one haunting the house of the new people. [laughs] Where I will just walk in and just be like, \"Hey, I'm here.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANDY:</em></strong><em><span> And are you, like, going around repairing things?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> No. I'm just, like, being somewhat shocked at what they've done to it. [laughs] It's like it never stops, you know?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Thanks, Matt.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> No problem.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Matt Kielty.

What am I doing here?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> [laughs] Well, I needed help. I needed a companion for this piece.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Okay. Lulu's out.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Lulu's out. Still on maternity leave. And I wanted you here for this story because you and I, we are both Canadians.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And I wanted to do a story that is not about Canada ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> ... but about something essential to this country, the United States. And I just thought there's a value to you and I not being from here in this foreign land.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Like we're aliens staring out of the cockpit of our UFO at the new land in front of us and observing? We're anthropologists.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Yeah, very polite anthropologists.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> [laughs] Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And so if we could, I would like for us to turn our Canadian eyes to the US Presidential election.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>NEWS CLIP:</em></strong><em><span> This election is close.

But it just looks so confusing. I'm just, like, in awe of how complicated it is.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Yeah, that's&mdash;that's the thing. When I first got here, the way this country picked presidents felt to me like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP:</em></strong><em><span> Here, we've got our reds, we've got our blues.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> ... a giant ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP:</em></strong><em><span> We've got our toss-ups.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> ...

It's always seemed so arbitrary and confusing, until I heard this story.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Oh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> This story for me felt like it explained so much about how Americans pick their president and why. But also that it didn't necessarily have to be this way. And there was a moment. There was one moment, not&mdash;like, much more recent than I expected, there was one moment where it all could have been a lot simpler and it almost was a lot simpler.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> Hello?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> Hey!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> Hi.

He's 34 years old.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So Birch died in 2019, but we were able to talk to two of his former staffers.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> I'm Jay Berman. At one point I was a legislative assistant to Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana. At another point I was the chief of staff.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BOB BLAEMIRE:</em></strong><em><span> And my name is Bob Blaemire. I spent the first 13 years of my adult life, starting as a freshman in college, working for senator Birch Bayh.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So a couple of things to know about Birch. One ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BOB BLAEMIRE:</em></strong><em><span> Birch had an ice cream addiction.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> He loved ice cream.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BOB BLAEMIRE:</em></strong><em><span> Which was the bane of my existence for many years.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> Why? Wait, why?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BOB BLAEMIRE:</em></strong><em><span> Because you're always on a tight schedule. And he would see a Dairy Queen and we had to go there. He carried a spoon in his briefcase. Seriously.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And then the other thing, which we already mentioned. He was really ambitious.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BOB BLAEMIRE:</em></strong><em><span> But he was a problem-solver. He would see something that needed to be fixed and go after it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And when he gets to the Senate in 1963, he immediately has a problem. I mean, it's a kind of petty, personal problem, but he is put on the Judiciary Committee because he'd gone to law school. But as a junior member, he doesn't get to chair a subcommittee. Which sounds like, who cares?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Sounds very boring.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Sounds very boring.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> But that's what people want?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Yeah. Because that's how you actually get a little slice of power in Congress. And how you can actually do things.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> Well, what happens is there was a subcommittee on constitutional amendments.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And it was kind of a dud of a committee.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> It didn't do a lot of work.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> It was known as the graveyard where proposed amendments go to die.

We're just, like, spending money on this thing. It's pointless.\" But Birch, when he finds out about this, he goes straight to the guy in charge and he's like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> \"Hey, don't worry about these budgetary concerns. I'll finance the committee out of my own Senate office budget.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And Birch is just telling him, like, \"Hey, come on.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BOB BLAEMIRE:</em></strong><em><span> \"It's available now.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> \"Nobody wants it.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BOB BLAEMIRE:</em></strong><em><span> \"Let me have it.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> \"I need something to play with.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Because he's just looking for something to grab onto.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah.

Right?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Mm-hmm. Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Like, it's this sort of political weapon now, right? But initially it was not supposed to be that. It was not political. It was just practical.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Birch Bayh:</em></strong><em><span> Writing the 25th Amendment to the Constitution is one of the ways I have been able to serve both Indiana and the nation.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And for Birch, you know, this young ambitious guy, like, this is a huge deal. Like a founding father-level achievement. He's still in his 30s.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Birch Bayh. What's his theme song?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> \"Hey, look him over.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> He's just singing it to himself in the graveyard.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> [laughs] That's right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> [singing] \"Check me out ...\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Okay, so he passes this constitutional amendment. And Jill says because it's so hard to pass an amendment ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> Once one happens, people are like, \"Oh, I forgot you can amend the Constitution.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And all of a sudden it's like a window opens ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> And there's a burst of amendment activity.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And suddenly Birch's graveyard became like a dance club that everybody wanted to get in, and he's the bouncer. You know what I mean?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> I was thinking, like, Candyland.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Yeah. He's the candyman, and everyone wants into the Candyland.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> I sort of feel like he's more of a candy guy than a dance club guy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> For sure. Sure. Fair.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> But yeah, so all of these people are coming to Birch with these ideas for what they want to see in the Constitution, including the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> And he says, \"Well, you know, you just passed a constitutional amendment. We'd like you to be the sponsor of one that we want, which is to eliminate what we call the 'faithless elector.'\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Faithless elector?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Faithless elector.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Like without religion?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> No. But okay, so here we are actually finally getting to the thing of electing a president.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Okay! [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So most people don't actually realize this, but when you vote for the President of the United States, you're not actually voting for the President of the United States. You're voting for someone who then votes for the President of the United States.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So those people are called 'electors.' And basically how this goes is, like, you vote in your state, your state has a certain number of these electors, and then the electors take a pledge to vote for the candidate who got the most votes in your state.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> But a pledge is a pledge. And it could be broken.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> In the history of US presidential elections, approximately 156 electors have broken that pledge ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> What?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> ... and either not voted or have voted for a different candidate.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> No!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Essentially have acted as faithless electors. And Johnson, for a lot of reasons, just thought, \"Okay, this is a problem. And Birch, you're a problem solver.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> \"So we'd like you to eliminate electors, and therefore the prospect of a faithless elector.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And Birch said ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> \"Sure, I'll introduce it as a constitutional amendment.\" But what happened?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> What happened was once Birch started holding these hearings on faithless electors, he started learning more and more about the Electoral College&mdash;about how it came to be, about why we still had it. And the more he learned, the more he became sort of radicalized, convinced that this system, the Electoral College ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> That it's a ticking time bomb.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And that somebody had to stop it. That's coming up after the break.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Latif.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Annie.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Radiolab. Okay, before we get going, I'm curious. What do you&mdash;what do you, as a Canadian here on a visa&mdash;what do you know about the Electoral College?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Okay, well I guess when I first got here, I thought this is probably a school you go to when you want to become president.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> It's a college. It is ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Ivy league, probably.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> That was my first question about it. Why is it called \"college?\" But you know what it is? It's like&mdash;so the use of the word \"college\" here&mdash;this is a total tangent. It's college like&mdash;you know how they have, like, the college of cardinals, or the college of surgeons or whatever? It's like \"college\" is just like&mdash;the meaning is just a group of people.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Oh, like a pod of whales.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> It's like a pod of whales. Yes. Exactly. Okay, so we left off, Birch Bayh is now focusing his problem-solving gaze on the Electoral College. He's having these committee hearings, and he's learning&mdash;right&mdash;why it exists, what it does, how it works. And so I think for us to be able to understand why all of this radicalizes him, we have to learn what he learned. We have to go back and understand the Electoral College.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Okay, let's go.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Let's go. Let's go all the way to the beginning, to explain ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> I thought we had started, but it sounds like we haven't even started yet.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> No. We haven't even started.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> That's amazing.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> It's so wonky.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Let's start.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> But we're ready. You have me. I'm your&mdash;I'm your Candyman.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> [laughs] I'll follow you anywhere.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Okay. All right. So here we go. So here we are in the Candyland that is Philadelphia, 1787. The Constitutional Convention. And the founding fathers are like, \"We're starting this new country. We're very excited about it. The thing we can all agree on is we do not want a king. But we do kind of need someone to be in charge, so we're gonna have this person called the president.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> But how are we gonna choose the president?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> That would require some thought.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Can I pause and take a little sip of Coke, here?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, of course. Go for it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> By the way, this is Alex Keyssar.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> Also, I should say, even in our first conversation, when I was talking to Jill ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> So there's a great book by Alex Keyssar called, Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> ... she brought you up. And then basically every other interview we've done for this story, people have brought you up.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> That's what I tried to do in that book. [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So he wrote the book, Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College? And he's also a professor of history.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> And social policy at Harvard University.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> But okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> So anyway, they&mdash;they couldn't agree on a method of choosing the president.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> And so there were some ideas on the table.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> One idea was, \"Well, we just came up with Congress.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> \"All right, well, Congress should just elect the president.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> But that's a bad idea.

People didn't know anybody beyond their own neighborhood or town.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So what they decided to do ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Was to take a break for a week.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> They just left Philadelphia.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> George Washington went fishing for the week.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> What?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> And they left behind a committee called&mdash;and you'll like this. It was called the Committee on Unfinished Parts.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> I kind of love that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Right? Okay, so these founders, most of whom you've never heard of, weeks later, they are still stuck there in Philadelphia.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> All the cool guys are fishing.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> All the cool guys are out fishing and doing other stuff and they have to figure this out.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> To get this thing done. They wanted to get it sent to the states.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So they're like, \"Okay, how do we do this? How do we pick a president? How do we do this?\" And then they figured it out. They were like, \"Okay, how about we just copy-paste Congress?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> What&mdash;what does that mean?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Well, it ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> How do you copy-paste ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Right, right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Like, just plagiarize?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> They're not gonna plagiarize. They're just like, \"Okay. We know everybody's already agreed on Congress, right?\" There's been a lot of debate, there's been a lot of arguing. But what they did to make a government that everybody agreed on, to make Congress, is they started putting thumbs on scales for different groups of people.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Thumb on a scale. Go over it for me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Okay, so one of the thumbs is they make the Senate, and they say every state, doesn't matter if you're big or small, you get two senators.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And so that's a little thumb on the scale for the small states that don't have a lot of people in them, so that they aren't completely overrun by the big states.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> The other thumb is for the South. They say, \"Okay, you can count an enslaved person in your state as three-fifths of a person. That way you boost the population of your state, and you get more representatives in the House.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Oh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> That was the other thumb, to give more power to the South so they weren't overrun by the North.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> You know, you can imagine them sitting there. \"Okay, so how do we choose a president? Well, the big states have more influence than small states. You know, and what about slaves? And then we're gonna reopen that whole thing? No, we're gonna import the whole thing.\" So what the Electoral College is is, in some respects, a replica of Congress. If you think about it, each state has electors equal to the number of representatives, plus the number of senators. Okay? And then the electors would convene in their state capitals and cast their electoral votes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So the committee's like \"Bingo, job done.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> That sort of seems smart to me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> It is. Under the circumstances, very clever solution.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So that&mdash;that all is stuff they put in the Constitution, right? So it's like there's this body of electors that vote for the president. Each state has a certain number of electors based on how many representatives they have in Congress. All of that is in the Constitution. What is not in the Constitution is how to convert the people's votes in the state into electoral votes. Do you do it proportionately?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Where if you get 53 percent of these states' vote ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> You get 53 percent of the electoral vote.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Right. Right.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Or you could do it by district. Each district in a state gets an electoral vote. But ultimately the founders are like, \"We're gonna let the states decide.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> That makes sense. That's, like, an important part of this country is that the states are making big decisions.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> That is an important part of this country, yeah. True. But that might be the biggest mistake they made in this whole process. And Alex says there is this pivotal moment pretty early on, where the system we now have starts to really take shape.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> In the 1800 election ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Between these two sort of juggernauts in the history of this country, Adams and Jefferson.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Now they have also run against each other in 1796.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And in that election, which Adams won ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Adams had gotten an electoral vote from the state of Virginia, Jefferson's state.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Because Virginia was doing district voting. Adams had won a district, so he got a vote.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> But in 1800, the Virginia legislature didn't want that to happen again. They saw a close election coming.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And so the Virginia politicians got together and passed a state law that said, \"Okay, we're done with this district system. From now on, the way our electors will vote will be ...\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Winner take all.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> If you win the majority of the votes in this state, all of our electors will cast their votes for you. And the Virginian politicians, they did this because they knew Jefferson was gonna win a majority of votes in their state, and this way, he wouldn't leave any on the table.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> That's a little dirty.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> A little dirty.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> I don't know, sounds a little smelly.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Yeah, the candy has gone smelly.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> [laughs] Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Because what they're doing is erasing all of the votes of the people who voted for Adams.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. No, exactly. And what's interesting when you look into the documents of it, is they passed that law and then they attached to it a kind of apology for doing it.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Effectively saying ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> \"We know this isn't really good or fair.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> \"We know this would be better for the country if we did not do this, but we're doing it anyway.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> So after Virginia did this, shockingly, Massachusetts, John Adams' state, retaliated and did a version of the same thing.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And Alex says after that, the states ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> They're off to the races.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Another state does it, then another state does it. And this is basically what the system is now. And what that system leads to is the feeling that your vote just doesn't actually matter. Because, like, if you vote for someone for president and then 50 percent plus one people in your state vote for someone else, your vote doesn't get counted. Like, for president, it means ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Thrown out.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> ... it's basically&mdash;it's effectively thrown out. And that is essentially happening to tens of millions of votes every presidential election.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Right. Hmm. Are you gonna make us feel better about voting by the end of this? Or ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Um, I think&mdash;I think so. I think so.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP:</em></strong><em><span> It is with pleasure that I introduce senator Birch Bayh.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Because I kind of think of Birch and what he was trying to do as a sort of beacon of hope.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Birch Bayh:</em></strong><em><span> Thank you very much Mark, members of the faculty and student body of UCLA. It's a privilege for me to have a chance to be here with you this afternoon and to share some of my thoughts.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So when Birch started holding those hearings in the mid-'60s on faithless electors, he's having all these different experts come in and testify about the whole history of the Electoral College, the fact that it wipes away all these people's votes, you know, all different kinds of things. But one of the things that these experts hit on over and over is that the system is actually fundamentally dangerous.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Birch Bayh:</em></strong><em><span> You may say, \"Well, why is it dangerous?\" Well, basically it's dangerous&mdash;the most dangerous aspect of it is the fact that the present system, the Electoral College system, does not guarantee that the man who wins is the man that has the most votes.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And Alex says that's because when you have this winner-take-all system ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> It transforms the contest into a contest among states. Because once you have winner-take-all, then winning the state really matters.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Winning as many people as you can doesn't.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Birch Bayh:</em></strong><em><span> And because of this, the political leaders of both of our major parties know ...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> You can lose the popular vote in the election ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Birch Bayh:</em></strong><em><span> It doesn't make any difference if you're soundly defeated ...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> ... so long as you win the right states.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Birch Bayh:</em></strong><em><span> ... you're going to have enough electoral votes to be elected President of the United States.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And this had almost just happened.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> In 1960. 1960 was one of those very close elections, where if, like, I think it was 20,000 or 30,000 votes had gone differently in a few states ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> The loser of the popular vote ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> Would have won, because of the Electoral College.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And this is the thing that all the experts were saying was dangerous, which was the very thing that terrified Birch.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> Because I mean, we think of the United States as in a particularly fragile moment historically right now. But that was also the case in the 1960s.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So remember, in '63 ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Walter Cronkite:</em></strong><em><span> Three shots were fired ...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> ...

I mean, like, in a&mdash;yes, I would say forty-something.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Twenty-three percent.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So if you get 50 percent plus one, in all the smallest states ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Yeah?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> ... you could conceivably get 23 percent of Americans' votes and become the president.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Hmm.

And in the Senate ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Birch hits a wall. A wall made up of two different groups of people. One of them was senators from small states.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> Now small state senators, mostly Republicans, said, \"Oh, well we get two votes automatically because we have two senators.\" And that was the compromise made at the constitutional convention.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Remember, those two senators was the thumb on the scale for the small states.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BOB BLAEMIRE:</em></strong><em><span> So I mean, think of Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, these states that have these electoral votes and no voters.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> These two votes are a big deal.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> And the small state senators wanted to preserve these two electoral votes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So that was one group. And then the other group standing in his way were Southern segregationists. And they were against Birch's amendment because the Electoral College in a winner-take-all system gave them more power, while continuing to erase Black voters.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> It was almost like the same thing back at the convention with the three-fifths clause.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Okay.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Because white segregationists could use the Black people in their state to count towards the state population, which gave them more electoral voters, more power.

Can you explain that?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BOB BLAEMIRE:</em></strong><em><span> What they're saying is that, \"If we as a bloc&mdash;\" you know, Blacks for instance typically had been voting 90 percent for the Democrats&mdash;if their votes can tip which way New York goes, or Florida or Illinois or some other state, then they're having a real impact on the Electoral College vote.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> Because those states, like, New York used to be a swing state?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BOB BLAEMIRE:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, California too. Mississippi too.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And so in these big, crucial swing states, Black voters and Jewish voters felt they had sort of an outsized power.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> I mean, Jesse Jackson ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Prominent Black leader at the time.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> ... proclaimed, you know, \"The hands that picked the cotton have now picked the president.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And this is kind of the thing about the Electoral College, especially in a winner-take-all system, is this possibility that a minority group like Black people or Jewish people or Hispanic people or even, like, labor unions, teacher unions ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Many groups that you could name, could become the decisive votes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Any minority in the right state at the right time could become extremely powerful.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> And thus, to switch to a national popular vote would remove that power.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And whatever group you belong to, you would just go back to being a tiny minority in the country as a whole. And the fear was from these Black leaders and Jewish leaders in the 1970s is that political parties could then just ignore them. And there's this amazing moment in a committee hearing on Birch's amendment. And Birch is obviously present for it. The leader of the National Urban League, a very prominent organization, Vernon Jordan, testified at the committee hearing. And he opens his testimony by saying, \"Me and Senator Birch Bayh are very close personal friends. Senator Birch Bayh has been a friend to Black people in this country. But I am here to say we do not support this amendment.\" And he goes on to basically say, \"We as a people have been denied power in this country for over 200 years. And now that we finally have some, you're trying to curb it.\" And basically goes even further to say if we were to support this switch to the national popular vote for president, our voting power would quote-unquote \"melt away.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>HARRY ROTH:</em></strong><em><span> You know, just to defend Vernon Jordan, his argument wasn't a hundred percent just, \"Hey, Black people are in these states, so we have some power.\" He has a good quote too. He said, \"The Electoral College system acts as a break to extremism.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So we also did speak to this guy, Harry Roth.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>HARRY ROTH:</em></strong><em><span> I'm director of outreach for Save Our States.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> A pro-Electoral College organization.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>HARRY ROTH:</em></strong><em><span> We defend the Electoral College system, trying to educate lawmakers and their constituents.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And we reached out to him because we saw he wrote an essay about this moment when Black leaders and Jewish leaders were coming out against Birch's amendment.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>HARRY ROTH:</em></strong><em><span> You know&mdash;and,I mean, I wouldn't say 1979 was the height of racism in America, but you know, Vernon Jordan, National Urban League, they were around for a while.

But with the Electoral College, that makes it much more difficult. You have to pay attention to Blacks. You have to pay attention to Jews who&mdash;I think Jews make up one percent of the population, but Jews make up what percentage of New York?

What are you doing here?\" He says, \"Well, we have no permanent friends and no permanent enemies, just permanent interests.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So basically what happens is these same Black, Jewish leaders kind of just go down the hall of the Senate and start knocking on doors.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Of a handful of liberal Democrats from big states.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And those liberal Democrats&mdash;including a young senator from the small state of Delaware, Joe Biden&mdash;vote against Birch's amendment.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And so in 1979, once again his amendment fails. But this time, the wall that stops him is liberal Democrats, the few remaining segregationists, and small state Republicans.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> Was&mdash;like, I don't know the degree to which you can say but, like, was that objectively true that they had more clout or sway as minority groups under Electoral College, versus how much they would have had in the popular vote?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> It was probably true in the 1976 election when Carter ran. But it certainly wasn't true as a broad pattern, and it was clearly evident within a very few years that it&mdash;it simply was not a dominant pattern or a clear pattern.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, wow. So it was like a truth with a shelf life?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ALEX KEYSSAR:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, a very short shelf life.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Hmm. Okay, so, like, what's&mdash;like, what's Birch's next step?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> So 1980, Reagan gets elected in a kind of landslide, and Birch loses his election. He's not in office anymore. And that's&mdash;that's the end of his career as a legislator.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> It's a sad story.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> I'm&mdash;okay, well that's a&mdash;because it sounds like you all were very productive. You all got a lot done.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> Well, Birch Bayh got a lot done. And we always described this as the one that got away.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> Like, this is the thing he would think about?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, yeah. It was&mdash;he said it was his greatest regret.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LATIF:</em></strong><em><span> Huh. Wow.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JAY BERMAN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> And, you know, there's this moment in one of Birch's oral histories where he kind of&mdash;he almost, like, turns on himself and he asks himself, like, \"What could I have done differently? What could I have done to keep that from happening?\" And I don't know, like, from even what I've read, from what we've read, like, it doesn't feel like there was anything he could've done differently, because this was just&mdash;this is the thing about the Electoral College. It's distributing power, right? And that's the whole thing about the Electoral College, that he&mdash;Birch didn't like, that it was distributing power. He thought power should be equal.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> But&mdash;and that gets to this kind of central question of democracy, which is, like, should you put thumbs on scales? How do you do it, and for which people? And for how long? And who gets them and who doesn't? And how hard do you press that thumb down? Those are fundamental questions, and they're really hard questions to answer.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ANNIE:</strong><span> Yeah, totally. And it seems like once you do put a thumb on the scale, it's just so hard to take that thumb off.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Yeah. Really hard. And Jill even pointed out that after Birch's amendment failed in 1979, like, that was kind of it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>JILL LEPORE:</em></strong><em><span> It is a kind of, you know, powerful pronouncement about the end of the campaign to abolish the Electoral College. Have we ever had a hearing on abolishing the Electoral College? Is there any&mdash;do we even still do public opinion surveys about it, you know? And the thing is, Birch Bayh was right that the more often a presidential candidate will win the Electoral College and lose the popular vote, the more likely it will be that at some point in the future, Americans will refuse to recognize the legitimacy of a president. And it doesn't matter which side you favor, you cannot favor an election where we can't all agree on the result.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP:</em></strong><em><span> This election is close.
