He lost both his parents to cancer. So Dennis was left, back in the house, alone. Until one night when a group of paranormal investigators showed up at his door and made him realize what it really means for a house\u2014or a man\u2014to be haunted.\u00a0<br><br>We have some exciting news!

We're celebrating Halloween by bringing you a ghost story for the occasion. There aren't a lot of radio stories out there that will genuinely spook you but also make you laugh out loud. And this one, oh man, does exactly that. We first released it exactly 10 years ago today, reported by our now senior producer Matt Kielty. This was one of his first stories, actually.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> It's about exactly how far one man is willing to go to understand his haunted house. This story is both a trick and the perfect fun-size Halloween treat. So here you go. Happy Halloween. Enjoy \"Haunted.\" Mwah-hah-hah-hah!</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[RADIOLAB INTRO]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I think there's a lot of moments in your life that you find yourself doing something.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine:</em></strong><em><span> Okay, if there is anybody in here, my name is Brittany.

Well, Dennis ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yes?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> ... it's about a lot of things but in particular, a house.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> So let's start with the house. When did you move back in?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Well, let's see. I was probably, I don't know, age 20.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Dennis had been going to college.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yep.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> By the way, what did you study?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Creative writing.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> Okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> But, you know, I just kind of got bored there, kind of stopped going to class. [laughs] I think once my parents realized that they weren't very happy.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> I would assume so.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And so I was kind of asked to come back home.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Back to a town just outside Kansas City.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> A little town called Grandview.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> Did you grow up in this house?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I did. I did. And the house was ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Fairly old.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, it was about 105 years old at the time.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Two-storey white house, nice little porch, awning over it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Typical farmhouse style.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> And so you were at your parents' home back in your old bedroom?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, in my old childhood bedroom. Yeah, so there was always a sense of, like, I need to get out of this house. It's holding me back somehow from things.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> So he got a job.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Worked a job and got laid off.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And one year turned into two. And then three, then four and then five.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> It was not a great time to be there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> In what way?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Just that I felt like I was still 16.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> He says he'd overhear his mom telling people on the phone ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> \"Well, he's never gonna move out, is he?\" [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And then she started circling classifieds.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Jobs for typists, printing press, sales rep, typesetter. I don't know. I think everything in my life, however I mean for it not to, sort of moves at my own snail's pace.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And eventually ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I was fairly old, like 27 maybe.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Actually, he was 28. After eight years in this house, Dennis gets a steady job, finds this cheap apartment.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> This ratty six-plex apartment.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> He starts packing up his things, but right when he's set to move out, to finally leave home ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> My mom got really sick.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Dennis's mom had been in remission from breast cancer for, like, nine years, but that summer her doctors told her that it had returned.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And had spread quite a bit. I said to her, \"Do you want me to be here or do you want me to go?\" And she was like, \"Well, if this is my time,\" she wants to go knowing that her kids can take care of themselves.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> So Dennis moved out. About five months later, his mom died.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. She went pretty fast. About a month or so after my mom died, my dad found out he had stage four prostate cancer.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> Wow.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And he was really too sick to take care of the house and just be the guy by himself at that point.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Now Dennis pretty much had to come home.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I'd take care of him ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Three, four times a week.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And as he got worse, he had said to me, like, \"Hey, let's try to find you a house to buy so that I can teach you how to do all of the kind of stuff that one has to do. Men know how to do things, like change out plumbing.\" All this kind of stuff. And so we put an offer on a house.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> But that fell through. And before they could find something else ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> The cancer from his prostate spread to his brain and the last week of his life, he was really not there. I can remember, one day, maybe a week or so after he had died ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Dennis was walking through the empty kitchen.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And there was so much stuff.

And so Brittany ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>[ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine: </em></strong><em><span>I don't know if I even explained to you what we do.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> ... who was like the ringleader of the night ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> She sort of explained how she does things. She was like, the best way that she could get them to talk to them was through flashlights.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Yeah. So what they do is they take a few flashlights, turn them on, and then they unscrew the tops of them just enough so that they turn off. And then they just kind of set the flashlights that are now off in the room by themselves. And the idea is that if the ghost or the spirit wants to communicate, they can just sort of touch the top of one of the flashlights with their ghost-y finger and that'll turn it back on.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>[ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine: </em></strong><em><span>It's barely connected. All they have to do is either push or pull a tiny bit of energy.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Katie:</em></strong><em><span> I see.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>[ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine: </em></strong><em><span>It's not that hard. It's obvious for them to do.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And I was like, \"Okay.\" And so she took three flashlights, and we all sat in this dark room in a circle. And ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Brittany sets the flashlights in the middle of the circle by themselves. No one's touching them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And she says ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>[ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine: </em></strong><em><span>If there's anybody in here, my name is Brittany. I'd love to be able to talk with you. Can you turn one of those lights on?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And they sit there and they sit there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine:</em></strong><em><span> Are you here?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And then all of a sudden this light kind of barely blinks on. And then she said, \"Okay.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine:</em></strong><em><span> Thank you.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> \"Please turn it off.\" And then it goes off.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine:</em></strong><em><span> What we can do with these lights here, is if I can ask them ...]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And then she says, \"We have three lights here.

Please turn on one more and that will be no.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine:</em></strong><em><span> If you could do that for us, that will be wonderful.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And then a second light comes on.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> No way! Are you scanning the room, looking for somebody who has a little switch or something?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. But, like, we didn't pay these people, so they have no reason to fake this, I suppose. But, you know, I just keep thinking, \"Well, the house is really close to the train tracks and maybe the train ...\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANDY:</em></strong><em><span> The vibrations of the train? Yeah, that makes sense.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> But all of a sudden they were like, \"Can you hear that?

It sounds like there is somebody walking right here in front of me.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And they're going towards the kitchen.

Is Mom here, too?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> And the other of the three flashlights lights up.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANDY:</em></strong><em><span> Huh.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Dennis Conrow:</em></strong><em><span> Yes, she is here.

That's weird. [laughs] That's a very bright yes. It means a lot to me. In a few days, guys, I'll probably never set foot in this house again. And I don't want you to, like, stay here and feel like you belong here. I want you to go out and be free. Can you let go of this house, to finally move on? That's fine. I'm going to leave you guys. You've been haunting my dreams a lot about this house. And I know it's very important to you. It's very important to me. It's time we leave, right? Yes. All right.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Katie:</em></strong><em><span> Are you okay?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Dennis Conrow:</em></strong><em><span> Yes.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Katie:</em></strong><em><span> Do you want a hug? [laughs]]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Brittany Elaine:</em></strong><em><span> I think you need one.]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MATT:</em></strong><em><span> So that's where it ends.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANDY:</em></strong><em><span> Hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> That's how I recall it being. Exactly like that. And I kind of teared up.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And keep in mind that this was the first time that Dennis had heard this tape, and so we played it back to him because we just wanted to see, like, how he remembered that experience.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> You know, I guess part of&mdash;part of my fear of listening to it was that it would change it, and that it would be a different experience. It would be a little more hokey and it would be a little more unclear what was happening, but listening to it again, it was as I recalled it being.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>So in the end, does he believe he was actually talking to his dead parents?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> No. No. I ended up actually calling this guy who explained to me how this whole flashlight thing works, and that there is a perfectly non-paranormal explanation as to what's going on with the flashlight.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> It almost feels bad manners at this point to have a practical explanation, but I'm very curious to hear it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> [laughs] What's going on is you turn the flashlight on.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And when you turn the flashlight on the bulb gets really hot.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Right.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> And then you take the top of the flashlight, and you unscrew it just enough that the flashlight flickers off. So the flashlight's off and the bulb, it got really hot so the inside of the flashlight also got really hot. And there's this little piece of plastic inside the flashlight that when it got hot, it expanded. And now since the flashlight's off, that piece of plastic, it starts to cool down and starts to contract. And when it contracts, it pushes these two tiny bits of metal together, these two little bits of metal come into contact. And that's your circuit. So the circuit opens, the light bulb, it goes back on.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh, then it warms again and cools again.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Then it gets hot, and so the little piece of plastic, it starts to get hot. It starts to expand and pushes the two pieces apart.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> And these people chose this flashlight because it had that particular property?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah, do you think it's like a con or something?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. I mean, I even talked to Dennis about this. He's like, \"I think they're just trying to make sense of randomness. I mean, I don't think they necessarily know that this flashlight does this thing and therefore they can manipulate people.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Well, here's why I don't think it's a con, because in this case it's such a strange coincidence that whenever he wants his mom and dad, his ghostly mother and father to approve of him and congratulate him and honor him with a yes&mdash;I mean, it's random he could get a, no but he gets a yes.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> It's just chance.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And you told Dennis all this?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> [laughs] Yeah, I told Dennis because you told me to tell Dennis.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>That's true. [laughs] That's right, I forced him. Okay, so when you told him, what did he say?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Well, on one level, like, it didn't faze him. Dennis basically said, like, \"Look, I know ...\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I know that the way that the world works is the way that the world works. People don't come back from the dead. People don't talk to you through flashlights.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> But he also said that, like, he's not gonna let go of that experience. He wants to have it both ways.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> I guess so. I guess I want to have both yes, this didn't happen and yes, this absolutely happened.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> I understand that.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Because even if you are the world's biggest skeptic, if you don't believe in ghosts, like,there really aren't that many ways to talk about these sorts of things, these sorts of things that we all feel. You know, guilt for the things that we've done in our past, the loss of those who we've loved. That,like, ghost stories seem to stick around because they are an experience, albeit like a metaphorical experience, but an experience that lets us talk about these things that we can't adequately talk about. You know, that feeling of being haunted.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>And so did he eventually sell the house and move out?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Yeah, sold the house, moved out.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>No more dreams of his parents haunting him.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> Well ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> It's been odd in the time that I've sold the house now. I thought the dreams would stop. And now the dreams are that I am the one haunting the house of the new people. [laughs] Where I will just walk in and just be like, \"Hey, I'm here.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ANDY:</em></strong><em><span> And are you, like, going around repairing things?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENNIS CONROW:</em></strong><em><span> No. I'm just, like, being somewhat shocked at what they've done to it. [laughs] It's like it never stops, you know?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Thanks, Matt.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>MATT:</strong><span> No problem.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD: </strong><span>Matt Kielty.
