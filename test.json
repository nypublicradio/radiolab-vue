Over the last year there has been a cascade of headlines about scientists trying to use AI to translate animal languages into a form we can understand. At this very moment, brilliant scientists and sophisticated algorithms are trying to decipher the snuffles of pigs, the honks of geese, the squeaks of mice, the barks of dogs, the caws of crows, the moos of cows, the clucks of chickens, the chirps of fruit bats, the meows of cats and the songs of sperm whales.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LATIF:</strong><span> Those are just the ones that have been reported in the last year or so. But turns out, people have been trying to listen and talk across the species divide for way longer than that. Today we bring you a Radiolab story originally broadcast in 2014 about what is, I would argue, the greatest and most shocking of these stories. And what's even better is it's told by a human in the first person, someone who was right there. Might not be appropriate for younger kids or more sensitive listeners, but with that warning here you go. \"Hello\" from Radiolab [squeaking]. That's how you say \"enjoy\" in dolphinese. I think.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[RADIOLAB INTRO]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN LEVY:</em></strong><em><span> Hello, this is Lynn.

And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> The balcony was flooded too?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> The balcony was also flooded.

So this all kind of sort of comes from this guy John Lilly, who was a scientist, a researcher starting in the '40s.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> A total Right Stuff physics major kind of guy out of Caltech.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Man's man, according to Graham Burnett.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> I'm a historian of science.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> But then, according to Graham, John Lilly has this epiphany.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> During the Second World War ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> At the time, people just weren't thinking that much about dolphins in general. Like, there was not this idea that they were sort of extraordinary beings. They were just like big dumb fish. You know, they were shot for sport.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So John Lilly is doing this research about brain mapping, and he ends up working with dolphins. And one of the&mdash;the story that he's told goes that he was experimenting on these dolphins, and as he's working with them, you know, kind of like shoving things into their brains, they make noises. As would anyone. And when he listens back to the noises which he's recorded, it sounds to him like the dolphins are trying to speak to him.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Hmm.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> To say something to him in&mdash;not in a&mdash;not in a dolphin-y way, but in a human way. Like, trying to speak English to him.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> What does he say the dolphin was trying to say to him?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I don't think that we know that, but it sounded to him enough like human speech that he thought, like, something's going on here. This is important. According to Graham, he said later that it made him realize, like, we're ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> We're not the only intelligent organisms out there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Like, we have company.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> That maybe humans are what happens when high intelligence evolves in an animal that also has hands, and dolphins are what happens when comparably, if not still more extravagant intelligence evolves in an animal without hands.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> What do hands get you?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> Well, hands basically get you an appetite for punching people in the head.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> I&mdash;you know, it makes us tool-users, but the distance between, you know, the hammer that you use to knock open your coconut and the hammer that you use to knock open the head of that other Cro-Magnon you were never that keen on is, in fact, zilch. There's no difference at all.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And by the time we get to the '60s with, you know, like, peace and love.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> It was exciting to think that the dolphins and the whales have these huge brains, but they don't, like&mdash;they're not after anything.

They're just, like, being, man.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And keep in mind, this is on the verge of the Vietnam War, where you have all this anxiety about ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Jim Morrison:</em></strong><em><span> [singing] What have they done to the Earth?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... overpopulation, environmental destruction.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[</span></em><strong><em>ARCHIVE CLIP, Jim Morrison:</em></strong><em><span> [singing] What have they done to our fair sister?]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So very quickly, the dolphins become like this vision ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>GRAHAM BURNETT:</em></strong><em><span> Of how we might ourselves be so different than we'd come to feel we were, tragically.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So John Lilly was one of the first people to get swept up in all this. He quits his government job, moves to the Caribbean and sets up this lab ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> John Lilly's Communication Research Institute.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... to try to talk to dolphins. Which is where Margaret ended up.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> And my feeling was this: that everybody was talking about how bright they were and how smart they were, and it was dolphins, dolphins, dolphins.

Yeah.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Her bed was on this kind of wooden platform in the middle of the apartment.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> I was maybe two and a half, three inches above the water.

But towards the end, things kind of started to unravel. First of all, there weren't really results from this experiment. They never were able to publish any scientific papers. And there were other problems. Lilly got very involved in drugs. Especially ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> LSD. He did bring it down. He did give LSD&mdash;he says he did, I believe him&mdash;to two of the dolphins. I would not let him give LSD to Peter. I wouldn't allow that.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Why would he give them LSD?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well, it's not a hundred percent clear, but it seems like he was trying to find a way to get the dolphins to open up, to connect. Maybe to talk. In any case, by 1965, '66, his funding had started to dry up. And when people heard about Margaret's work, they tended to focus on, like, one particular part of the story.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> You don't have to answer, but a lot has been made of your sort of sexually engaging with Peter. And I just want to ask&mdash;because you don't seem like a shrinking violet&mdash;I just want to ask, is there anything you want to say about that?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> Um, what would I like to say about that? I think the sensational side of it is ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Here's what Margaret told me: Peter was a young dolphin, he was horny and he would hump her leg a lot, kind of like a dog might do, which was getting in the way of their work.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> So eventually, I just said, \"The heck with it.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And she'd use her hand to, you know ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> And&mdash;and it would quickly satisfy him, and then we could go back to doing what we were doing.

People didn't want to be associated with Lilly. Nobody wanted to fund anything that sounded like Lilly. It just got this, like, aura of ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Don't go there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... don't go there. Even people who wanted to do really rigorous work with human-dolphin communication had a tough time getting any funding. And that lasted for a long time. And the thing is, even though there are so many reasons to disapprove of this experiment, when you talk to Margaret you can't help but want to be in that apartment with them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> He would come over, and when he was in what I call his sweet mood&mdash;and Peter had a lot of very, very sweet mood to him&mdash;he would sink to the bottom and take my foot in his mouth. And he wasn't sonaring, and he wasn't looking at anything. It was almost like a little kid comes and just wants to hold your hand, and he would just sink to the bottom and close his eyes and just hang on to my foot. And then he'd have to come up and breathe and then he'd go back down. And he'd just grab my foot. And he would do this for a good while.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> We'll be back in a moment with another encounter.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> I'm Robert Krulwich.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> This is Radiolab. And today ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Hello.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Yes!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Or as a dolphin might say ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> How would a dolphin say it?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> I don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Well, then&mdash;but you know what? That is exactly kind of the question of this next segment. I mean, the dream that a human being can talk to a dolphin, or any animal really, get in their heads, cross that gap ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> This is a dream that humans have had for since, like, forever.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Yeah. St. Francis of Assisi. Goes way back. Now insofar as dolphins are concerned, after the John Lilly situation, researchers did get a little tepid.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Yeah. But they didn't stay tepid, as you say, for long.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> No.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Because along came this woman.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Dr. Denise Herzing. Director of the Wild Dolphin Project.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Who basically decided to take John Lilly's experiment and flip it. Rather than have the dolphin speak English, let's have the human speak dolphin. Or at the very least, let's create a shared language where humans and dolphins can speak.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Or at least whistle.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Well, you know, it's about finding&mdash;finding a place you can meet.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Back to producer Lynn Levy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Okay. So for Denise, this dream of finding that meeting spot, it goes back to when she was a little girl.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Well, when I was 12 years old, I used to page through the Encyclopedia Britannica in the days when we had books.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Mm-hmm.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> And I would always stop at the whale and dolphin page, look at the dolphins and go, \"Wow, I wonder what their brains are like? Because they've evolved in the water.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> You were thinking that when you were 12?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> I was. I was&mdash;I was a total nerd. In fact, I entered this contest in Minnesota, like, \"What would you do for the world if you could do something?\" And I actually wrote, \"I would build a human-animal translator so we could figure out what was going on in the minds of animals.\" So yeah, I don't know. I got the bug early and here I am.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT:</em></strong><em><span> Were you having a fantasy about what you might learn? Or ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> A fantasy? No, I was just curious. So I don't know, you look in their eyes, there's definitely something behind there. You just want to know what it is.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Fast forward many years. Denise got a boat.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> And I went out to the Bahamas.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> She was like, \"If I'm gonna study these dolphins, I'm gonna do it in the wild.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> That's where they live.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So she tracked down a pod of wild dolphins.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Yep. Yep.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And she just tried to blend in.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> I actually anchored the boat in one spot most of the time.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> This spot in the Bermuda Triangle.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> The middle of, I call it, \"The dolphin highway.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Where dolphins come and go.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> They could come by if they wanted to. And if they didn't, they didn't.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> When they would come by, she and her team would just slip into the water.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> And behave ourselves.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Just sort of watch. Paying attention to who was who, which dolphin had a crooked fin, which one didn't.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> And when they'd leave, we'd get out, and that's really how we operated for the first five years. And it worked fine.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Five years? She spent five years just watching? Not doing anything else?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Yes.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Doesn't this take an enormous amount of patience?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Well, sure. I mean, but after about five years they started realizing, well these guys aren't gonna grab us and poke us and prod us. So they started just going about their own business.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Like feeding, mating ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Nursing ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... and talking.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Or at least making a lot of noises.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Which she and her team would record.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Wow! That's all dolphin squeaking?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well, dolphins make&mdash;they make all these&mdash;yeah, like that. There's like a clicking, kind of creaking sound that they make.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh, sounds like a zipper.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Zipper. Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah, they make, like, whistles that are more kind of distinct, and then they make sounds that are, like, longer and weirder. And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> And do you have any sense that each of these sounds means something different?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Well ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> That's exactly what we don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> ... I could tell you what kinds of sounds are correlated with fighting and with mating or disciplining a calf. What we don't know is are there detailed kind of words in there? Is there more kind of encoded information?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> But what they do know is that each dolphin seems to have its own kind of signature whistle.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Which is basically a name. Every individual has its own name.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> Peter had a name. Nobody's ever asked me that.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Here's Margaret again.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> And his name was ... [imitating dolphin sound]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Really?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MARGARET LOVETT:</em></strong><em><span> It was almost saying, \"Peter here.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Right. So I can call you \"Lynn\" by your whistle, and you \"Robert\" by your whistle.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT:</em></strong><em><span> So I could be a dolphin going [imitating dolphin], Lynn!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Exactly.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Do they do that?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> They do.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Not only that, apparently dolphins will use the names of other dolphins who aren't even around. Like, they can't see them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Like, they'll talk about each other behind their backs?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yes, maybe.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Wow! That means that they're using representations of things which aren't in front of them, which is sort of like the beginning of language.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> If that's what they're doing&mdash;and we don't know&mdash;but if that's what they're doing, then yeah, that's kind of like the edge of language.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> So, you know, it gives us hope that there's probably more information going on there than we know.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And now finally, she has that device.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Which device again?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> The magical, you know, human-animal translator device that she was dreaming of and writing about when she was 12.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Ah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> She has this box that can generate dolphin noises and it can recognize dolphin noises. And if it works the way that, you know, that she's dreaming it will work, it could be the first, like, real two-way back-and-forth conversation between a human and a wild animal.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> So we're looking forward to the summer and getting out and getting more data and really exercising the boxes and see what happens. Good, we're ready.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So I begged my way aboard.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Everybody good? Seasick pills for tummies?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> We left on July 8 from Florida and headed for The Bahamas to see this pod that she's been following kind of forever.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Almost 30 years now.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RADIO:</em></strong><em><span> I just saw Stenella.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> The boat is called the R/V Stenella.

And if they do call her name, this name that she's made for herself, then the box should be able to recognize it, and can tell her that she's been called by name.

So she gets into the water over and over, and she says, you know, have the equivalent of, \"Hi, I'm Denise. Hi, I'm Denise,\" over and over and over. And they learn it. You know, they develop this ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh, like maybe they'll just start to use it and call her.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> So you hope&mdash;you hope they call you.

For a while I was on this boat I was like, why is this so hard? Like, seems like it should be&mdash;these people are so smart, like, this should be easy, but they're just like constantly being defeated by the ocean, basically. Which&mdash;and the ocean is like a worthy foe. But it's like the first year ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> First year was a complete disaster trying to get the hardware to work.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> What happened the first year?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Everything broke.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> It was leak city. Basically, the boxes just kept shutting down as soon as they would get in the water.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> [laughs] That's not good.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> It's not good. That's sort of not what you want.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> No.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And last year ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> We had the boxes working, but then we couldn't find the dolphins.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> The dolphins just disappeared.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROBERT:</em></strong><em><span> Where did they go?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> You know, they went a hundred miles away to another location.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> They don't know why.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> I kept up with my side of the deal, Denise.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> I know, I know!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Your dolphins stood you up.

[laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> [laughs] Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Like, wearing like my shorts and like a bra. And I had like, all modesty aside&mdash;like, thrown aside. They were like, \"You can go in.\" And I was like, \"Okay, okay, okay! Go on.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Jesus Christ, here I go.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> We'll be right back.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> I'm Robert Krulwich.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> This is Radiolab. And today ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> The show's called \"Hello!\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Back to Lynn.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I mean, it's a total sensory shift. The temperature changes, everything goes quiet. It almost feels like this, like, classic Through the Looking Glass moment where you&mdash;like, you go through the looking glass and, like, everybody's walking on the ceiling.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Huh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And I jumped in, and there were two pretty big dolphins coming right at me like maybe two feet from my head, and staring at me. And I was like \"Uh, I don't know what&mdash;I don't&mdash;\" [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> What did you do?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I stayed very still. I pretty much froze.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> And how far were they from you?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Two feet.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh my God!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah, yeah. Dolphins are not small, and they were looking at me in a way that was like, \"We see you.\" And also, they're&mdash;they make these ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... sort of clicking sonar-y sounds which are, like ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Do you think they were talking to you, or just talking about you?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well, no. And I mean, what I think they were doing is ...</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... is sonaring me.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh, I see.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Sort of looking at me with their&mdash;with sound. I mean, my head was vibrating.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Whoa!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I mean, they can see not just body shape, they can see your bones.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> They can see into you. Like, you really feel looked at.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> It was heart stopping.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> That was un[bleep]ing believable! [laughs]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> That's what I was waiting for.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, that was so cool!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> At that point I was like, the trip could end now and I'd go home happy, you know? And everybody was like, \"Calm down. Those weren't even the right dolphins.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> What do you mean?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well, those were bottlenose dolphins. Denise studies spotteds.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> But the next day ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> All right. Onward for spotteds.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Spotteds or bust.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... we set out again. Go for a few hours. Bethany does this dolphin dance.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>BETHANY AUGLIERE:</em></strong><em><span> Me being energetic. Spotteds!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Oh! Got some.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> You saw him, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, right there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, there we go. Gotta be spotteds, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So then everybody's like&mdash;you know, it's like all-hands-on-deck situation. Everybody's, like, strapping on the boxes and strapping on headphones.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> What are you doing?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh, so there's a lot of scrambling.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> There's so much scrambling.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, there's one off the bow here.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> It's like a fire&mdash;it's like a fire drill. Now ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> I'm putting on my box.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... here's the problem.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> I'm just testing.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Unlike a captive dolphin, wild dolphins, they have other things to do. They have, you know, fish to catch. You kind of have to entice it into having a conversation, otherwise it'll just swim away. But how do you do that when you don't know its language? Well, turns out dolphins are just crazy for scarves.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Scarf high, scarf low.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> When you throw them a scarf, they sweep it up with their tail fin, and then they let it go and it wafts through the water, and another dolphin comes up and sweeps it up with their rostrum. So the idea is you use the scarf as kind of like a bridge. Denise and another diver will get in the water with a scarf.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> We'll get in the water and we'll just start ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Passing it back and forth.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Human to human.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Like, \"Hey, look at this fun thing we're doing.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Let them watch. If they want to get in the game, we let them in the game. Sometimes we'll take the toy over to them, show it to them and press the word for scarf. [whistle] Say, \"Hey this is a scarf.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> They just made up a whistle for \"scarf?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yep. And ideally&mdash;and this is the key&mdash;the dolphins will pick up the word and use it too to ask for the scarf. If and when they do that, then you've got, like, a tiny bit of common ground that you can build on. Okay ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Who you got?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> We have four spotted dolphins.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> Our little candidates Sisten and Pallet.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Yes, you've been waiting for them, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> We have!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Just before they jump in, Denise walks another diver through the game plan.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> Oh.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> So you're gonna hold it and you're not gonna give it to him.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> Okay.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> You're gonna entice it with him. You're gonna be like, \"Oh this is so nice.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> Should I like, dive down with it and, like, wave it? Or ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah. First start at the surface, and just really get them with you.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Moments later ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DIVER:</em></strong><em><span> All clear?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Good. We're ready.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... Denise jumps in, followed by three other divers.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Four in the water.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Were you in the water this time?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> No, I actually had to watch the whole thing from the deck. And, like, you could see from the surface three or four adolescent dolphins.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>RESEARCH ASSISTANT:</em></strong><em><span> See? Denise is right up next to one of them.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> You see the back of her head and her little snorkel.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, that's good. She's surrounded right now.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> What are they doing?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> I'm not sure.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, they're kind of like twisting around each other.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I will say this: she is tremendously graceful in the water. She gets in the water and she's, like, totally at home.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> So maybe she is a dolphin?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> She might secretly be a dolphin.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Going, like, around and around. There she goes under. Man, what is happening under there?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> This is what it sounds like underwater.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> This is the actual sound from this scarf dance?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> They record everything that goes on under there.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> I mean, a lot of that is the dolphins just doing whatever they're doing. But some of it is Denise with the box making this scarf whistle over and over like, \"Scarf! You want the scarf? Yeah? Scarf?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Because she's, like, trying to get the dolphin to say the word, right?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah. Eventually, she and the dolphins surface, and ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> He's got the scarf right there.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Oh! Ah, he's got the scarf!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... one of the dolphins is holding the scarf.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Hey!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> It's like this flash of red.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Yep.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And then they all go back under.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> And if Denise comes back up with it, that's real good.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> All right. Wait and see.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> After about a minute, she surfaces.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> I think Denise has it now.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> She dives one more time.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span>[dolphin clicking]</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> A minute later, dolphin has the scarf. And this went on and on. They were passing it back and forth so fluidly that I thought maybe the dolphin has begun to ask for the scarf by name. Eventually, Denise gets ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Gravity sucks!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... hauled back up onto the boat. And we all just sort of gather around like, \"Well, well?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, the two juveniles picked up the scarf right away, and we played some signature whistles and played some scarf whistles and then some sargassum came floating by.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Piece of seaweed.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Showed them that, played the sargassum whistle.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> You think you got the name in?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Nothing that triggered the system. But, you know, we'll see what it looks like. Whew! It's exhausting.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Wait, she didn't get anything?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well I mean, nothing the box recognized as a match. You know, nothing that indicated the dolphin, like, learned a word.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Aww!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> But it's like they were right there!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> But there was this one thing that happened: she said that when she addressed one of the dolphins by its name, the dolphin turned around and looked at her and kind of cocked its little dolphin head.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yes.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh! I so was hoping that you'd say that!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> [laughs]</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Oh, wow!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Also, there was this moment where Thad and Celeste were looking at the data later.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Who is that?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> And they saw that right after Denise made her signature whistle ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Is that somebody responding with her signature whistle?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> ... another dolphin made its signature whistle.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>THAD STARNER:</em></strong><em><span> Sweet!</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>CELESTE:</em></strong><em><span> Whoa! That's pretty cool.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> You mean, like, she said, \"Hi,\" and it said \"Hi\" back?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> That's amazing!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Well, maybe. I mean, the thing is dolphins make their signature whistles all the time.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Oh.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> So it could be nothing. Or it could be this moment. I mean, she's a very rigorous scientist. Like, she wants that to happen another 30 times.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Before even starting to take it seriously.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> But still, it does make you think about the possibilities.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> What do you want to ask?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Oh, I don't know. I want to ask everything, so ...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Like what?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Well, I'd like to know what their lives are like when we're not around. I mean, how do you spend your day? You know, do they think about things? I mean, do they think about the future? Do they think about the past? I mean, we know they have long-term memories. You know, do they remember their calves from 10 years ago?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>LYNN:</em></strong><em><span> Do they think about death?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>DENISE HERZING:</em></strong><em><span> Yeah, they certainly see it. Could be anything you'd ask your friends, right?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Hmm. Although part of me wonders, like, are they ever gonna even get there?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> What do you mean?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Well, if the goal is to have a conversation, and you're gonna do it this way where you're in the wild and you can't touch them and you've gotta verify every whistle 35 times, well are they ever actually gonna have a conversation?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Well, but it's like day one of the language lesson.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Yeah, I get it. But, like, don't you feel like Margaret was&mdash;all the problems with that experiment aside, she was actually getting somewhere with Peter? Like, they were actually having a real exchange?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> In the moment, perhaps. But thinking forward, I believe that what you can accomplish by talking, by having a two-way conversation, is just infinitely greater.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> And I totally agree, but if it's taken her 30-something years to get to a maybe hello.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> She doesn't even know if she got to hello yet. And if all she has is just a limited amount of time with these dolphins every summer, then 50 more times is gonna take her 50 more years. And I'm just like, oh God, the planet is gonna be 17 degrees warmer by that point. Dolphins are gonna have all migrated to some other spot. It just feels like, oh, come on! Just get in the pool and hold&mdash;let the dolphin hold your foot.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> [laughs] She's already got the hello going for her, maybe, so that's like a start. And then, yes, in 50 years, she may have moved past hello to ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> A three-word sentence.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> \"How's your mackerel today?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah. I think that, too. A three-word sentence, yes. I would put money on a three-word sentence in 50 years. The question is, do we ever get to the point of ...</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Exploring death?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Yeah.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>ROBERT:</strong><span> Yeah, I don't know.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Lynn, do you have faith?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>LYNN:</strong><span> Hmm. I have faith that if Denise continues with what she's doing, that we'll be able to talk about concrete things. We'll be able to talk about seaweed, and we'll be able to talk about coral, and we'll be able to have a scintillating conversation about scarves. I do believe that. And that is not nothing. I mean, that is pretty impressive in its own way.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>JAD:</strong><span> Big thanks this hour to our producer Lynn Levy.
